Lewisberg All Blacks,Adrian,Del Castillo,,ARI,,,,50,Med,25.5,50.0,45.0,55.0,20.0,"Del Castillo looked like he might be the best catcher in his draft class and a potential future top 10 pick during his freshman year at Miami, a season that saw him also play some third base and right field. A COVID-shortened sophomore campaign meant he didn't get the opportunity to repeat that performance and solidify his spot in the class, and then Del Castillo regressed as a hitter during his junior season and was a buy-low of sorts at pick no. 67. After a rough, strikeout-prone introduction to pro ball in 2021 and 2022, Del Castillo has been raking, and debuted with the big league club late in 2024. The hitting environments at Arizona's upper-minors affiliates — Amarillo and Reno — should generate some skepticism about his overall statline from the last two seasons, but importantly, Del Castillo posted a career-best strikeout rate (by a huge margin) in 2024, and his strength and conditioning looks as though it has taken a meaningful step forward. 
Del Castillo still has some issues on defense. Most significantly, his 2.05-ish second pop times are at the bottom of what tends to be acceptable for a regular catcher (he hasn't played other positions as a pro). His excellent accuracy makes up for this to some extent, but he has allowed a career 80% stolen base success rate in the minors, with a 93% success rate on 29 attempts during his call-up to Phoenix. Other aspects of Del Castillo's defense are also below average, but not so bad that he needs to change positions. Speedy opposing offenses will turn games against him into a track meet, but with Gabriel Moreno entrenched as the primary guy, los Serpientes get to pick their spots with the way Del Castillo is deployed. 
He's going to hit enough to justify some DH/1B reps, too, and depending on whether Arizona re-signs or replaces Joc Pederson and Christian Walker, Del Castillo could see 400 PA in 2025 as a combo backup catcher and platoon DH. He can still be beaten by well-executed fastballs up and away from him, but you had better put it there because he can do damage throughout the rest of the zone, especially against stuff on the inner half. His added strength shows in his TrackMan stats, as Del Castillo's measurable power has taken a leap in two consecutive years; for example, his hard-hit rate has risen from 29% to 46% during that time. The big question here is whether Del Castillo's significant improvement in strikeout rate will hold multi-year water. It's logical that the added strength has had an impact on Del Castillo's raw power, but has it also somehow made him a more skilled hitter? His batting stance changed somewhat in 2024, but the rest of his swing really hasn't. He has always had lovely hitting hands, and he tracks and identifies breaking stuff, he just struggles to get on top of a somewhat large subset of heaters. Were Del Castillo definitely a ""no"" at catcher, then maybe a strikeout rate regression to his career norm would be something to fear, but there's enough playable power here for him to be considered a primary catching prospect in a vacuum."

FA,Trey,Sweeney,,DET,,,,45,Low,24.9,40.0,40.0,45.0,40.0,"The 20th overall pick in 2021, Sweeney adjusted to pro ball pretty quickly despite his small school pedigree. He reached Double-A during his first full season, and was sent to the Dodgers for Victor González and Jorbit Vivas the following year. Then in 2024, he was traded to Detroit as part of the Jack Flaherty deal and made his debut in mid-August. He's a career .254/.356/.435 hitter in the minors. Sweeney's carrying tools are his rare raw power and bat speed for a lefty-hitting shortstop. He posted a 46% hard-hit rate and a 105.4 mph EV90 in 2024, both comfortably above the average of a big league shortstop. But Sweeney has never quite been able to access all of his power in games because of the downhill nature of his swing, which also causes him to swing over top of a lot of breaking balls, and because he lacks great feel for flush contact. His chase rate also really popped during his 36-game big league sample at the end of 2024, though that has not tended to be an issue for him historically. 
On defense, Sweeney is a bit slower and heavier-footed than the typical big league shortstop. He does enough to be playable there, but he's definitely below average. Some of the sweet looking plays he makes at the very extremes of his range an average big league shortstop would make look more routine. Sweeney is built like Josh Jung, and it's rare for an athlete that size to be an impact shortstop glove. He's got a second-division regular's look."

FA,Jorge,Barrosa,,ARI,,,,40,Low,24.1,60.0,60.0,30.0,55.0,"The 5-foot-6 Barrosa became the shortest player in the majors when he debuted early in 2024 due to an Alek Thomas injury; he was previously over-listed at 5-foot-9, until the ABS implementation in the minors forced a correction. Skilled and entertaining as hell, Barrosa is a plus contact hitter and capable center field defender with highlight reel ball skills, but perhaps dwindling range. His general athleticism took a bit of a step back in 2024, which was most noticeable on defense, where Barrosa wasn't covering quite as much ground. His creativity at the catch point is still special, but overall he looked more average than plus on defense in 2024, which is the chief reason his grade slides a bit here compared to our last update. 
Barrosa's swing has a lot of big movement and noise in his hands, which he gets away with because he's so small — it's basically impossible for a guy his height to have a long swing. He's been a plus contact hitter for his entire minor league career and is really cooking when he's spraying doubles from line-to-line. Barrosa is chase-prone, which puts a dent in his overall output and projection as a team's fifth outfielder. His ability to pinch run, put the ball in play when you need it, and act as a defensive replacement in the corners should give him enough utility to be rostered consistently."

Richmond Hippies,Coby,Mayo,,BAL,14.0,29.0,,50,High,23.3,40.0,45.0,65.0,40.0,"Mayo had a five-year track record of mashing dating back to high school before elevated strikeouts began to creep into his profile once he was promoted to Double-A. Since arriving in Bowie and then Norfolk, his K% has hovered around 25%, while Mayo's underlying contact rate has slowly dipped into a problematic range, from 75% to 73% to 70%, as he's progressed up the minor league ladder the last three years. Mayo's funky, pull-heavy swing generates enormous pull-side power and loft, and he's on time to destroy fastballs (his splits against plus velocity are great) even though he's a massive, long-levered 6-foot-5 guy. His tendency to pull off toward the third base side has left him very vulnerable to sliders on the outer half, and as Mayo has faced more sentient pitching at the upper levels, that has been more consistently exploited. In spite of this, Mayo crushed Triple-A (.287/.364/.562) at age 22, including after he returned from a month-long IL stint due to a fractured rib. He looked positively lost during his 17-game, late-season big league call up to Baltimore, in which Coby K'd in nearly half of his plate appearances. He is starting to have a more polarized power-over-hit offensive profile, but Mayo is so strong and his swing is so tailored to get to all of his power in games that he should still be an everyday bat. 
Mayo's profile becomes a little dicey if he ends up at a first base-only defender. His size makes it hard for him to move around at third base, and he has been speculatively projected to right field here at FanGraphs since before he was drafted because that's the position that best takes advantage of his plus max-effort arm strength. The Orioles have shown no inclination to try Mayo out there, and began to deploy him at first base semi-frequently starting in 2023; he has played about 20 games there each of the last two seasons. It's not ideal for a hitter whose bat is nearly ready for prime time to still have such an out-of-focus defensive fit. If Mayo can successfully play a more valuable position than first base, it will take pressure off the need for him to resolve his issues with sliders and give him a better chance to be a star-level performer. At first base (where he's now projected, though I'd still love to see a right field trial ASAP), he's more of an average regular."

FA,Liam,Hicks,,MIA,,,,35+,Low,25.8,60.0,70.0,30.0,30.0,"Hicks was drafted in the 2021 ninth round out of Arkansas State and signed for $30,000. He made plus rates of contact all the way up through Double-A with the Rangers before he was traded to the Tigers at the 2024 deadline as part of the package for Carson Kelly. He’s a .274/.405/.374 career hitter in the minors and has a unique statistical profile thanks to his combination of contact ability (he had a 6% swinging strike rate in 2024) and the extreme uphill launch created by his swing. He takes his cuts bent at the waist with his hands over the top of the zone and his bat has a vertical angle through contact. Hicks had an 18 degree average launch angle in 2024, near the top of what is sustainable at the big league level. As you can probably tell from his career SLG, Hicks lacks the power to weaponize his bat path. In fact his contact is so light that it detracts a bit from his ability to hit for average even though he’s making so much of it. Hicks has also struggled to develop on defense. Too often he just whiffs on catching pitches altogether, and he gives up a ton of long rebounds on balls in the dirt. It’s possible his defense will not allow him to stick on Miami’s roster. A fascinating statistical outlier, Hicks projects as a team’s third catcher long-term."

Fairfax Flying Squirrels,Arjun,Nimmala,,TOR,86.0,,,50,High,19.5,40.0,45.0,60.0,40.0,"Nimmala was one of the youngest prospects in the 2023 draft and also one of the most projectable, both because of his big, broad-shouldered frame and because he's new enough to baseball to merit deeper, skill-centric projection. He struggled mightily with breaking ball recognition as an amateur, and at his size, it seemed feasible that he might also need to move off of shortstop. 
In 2024, Nimmala had his ass handed to him during the first several weeks of the season. He was hitting .167 in the middle of May and was demoted to the complex, where his swing was re-worked. It seems to have made a real difference. Nimmala's leg kick and the position of his hands as they load were both altered. When he returned to the Dunedin roster, he hit .265/.331/.564 and stroked 13 bombs in his final 53 games. 
This isn't to say Nimmala is suddenly a lock to be an everyday infielder. He still struck out 29.7% of the time during his hot second half of the season, which is a scary rate at Low-A. His overall contact rate (69%) also wasn't great, but there is at least precedent for power-hitting big leaguers to carry a rate that low and still be impact players. Nimmala already hits the ball very hard. He is a ferocious rotator and is able to generate considerable power because of the strength and quickness of his hitting hands, which are gigantic. Nimmala is able to create big power in a relatively short distance, and his swing isn't overly noisy or hard to maintain. He's also elevating the baseball at an Andy Pages-esque 21 degrees of launch on average, and he's often on time to pull the baseball thanks to a strong top hand through contact. Toward the end of the year, Arjun showed glimpses of being able to cover the outer third and drive the ball to the opposite field gap with power. 
Nimmala is also a terrific bender for his size and has a shot to remain at shortstop. That said, his feel for throwing isn't great, his body doesn't always sequence well from the ground up, and his mechanics can get out of whack. He needs to work on more consistently transferring his weight from one foot to the other, which he badly struggles with on backhand plays. The tools to be an impact power-hitting shortstop are here, and Nimmala will be 19 for basically all of 2025. He was always going to be a slower burn, and now he's shown that he can pretty quickly make relevant adjustments."

Gomez still has serious pitch recognition and bat control issues that will limit his offensive output. He's also still not a very good ball-blocker, and for all his other merits on defense, this is still a pretty serious issue.

FA,Henry,Bolte,,ATH,,,,35+,High,21.7,30.0,30.0,40.0,80.0,"Bolte is a super toolsy prospect with very intense, profile-altering strikeout issues. He's struck out at least a third of the time at each minor league stop (usually more), but at some of them has still found a way to hit for big power. Bolte is a flat out 80-grade runner with plus raw power and room for more strength on his frame. His swing isn't especially functional and often leaves him inside-outing the baseball the other way. He is likely to strike out at a roughly 40% clip against big league pitching as his swing is currently constituted. 
But Bolte's physical prowess is so impressive that when he reaches his physical prime in five years or so, he might be toolsy enough to have a window of meaningful big league impact despite his flaws. He's someone to watch over a very long period of time, a player who isn't likely to break out until he's on his second org via six year minor league free agency. It will be important for his feel for outfield defense to improve during that time as, despite Bolte's speed, his feel and instincts out there aren't great."

At age 23, Cairo slashed .240/.354/.326 during a 2024 campaign split between Double-A Akron and Triple-A Columbus. The Braves took Cairo in the Rule 5 Draft because of his defense, and he'll likely compete with Nick Allen for an Opening Day roster spot as the team's glove-first utilityman, which is Cairo's ultimate projection. Though he lacks prototypical shortstop arm strength (and sometimes air mails throws when he's a bit out of range), Cairo is otherwise an elegant and skillful shortstop defender with fantastic footwork and actions, a plus fielder despite his substandard arm. He has below-average bat speed but pretty good feel for moving the barrel around the zone, and Cairo generates soft line drive spray to all fields."

Fairfax Flying Squirrels,Konnor,Griffin,,PIT,,57.0,,45+,High,18.9,40.0,40.0,55.0,70.0,"Griffin went wire-to-wire as one of the most talented high school players from the 2024 draft class during its two-plus year scouting window. He was a super-projectable SS/RF as an underclassman and got into the mid-90s on the mound. He has already grown considerably stronger and is now a hulking 6-foot-4, 225 pounds. Griffin played shortstop for his 6A State Champion high school team in Mississippi, but mostly played right field in games with Team USA and at select events; he's probably a little too stiff to play the infield in pro ball. The speed with which Griffin can go zero to 60 at his size is incredible. He takes huge, powerful strides and motors around the bases with a rooster tail of dirt kicking up from his spikes. His reads and routes in the outfield aren't great even though Griffin has the speed for center field, which is why he was mostly relegated to right on Team USA. 
Griffin's bat-to-ball track record was very good across multiple years on the showcase circuit, but long levers often make him late on fastballs, and this will probably get worse in pro ball. Griffin looks a little less limber now that he's filled out, and some of the funky ways he'd move to get the bat on the ball have gone away as he's stiffened, but getting strong was probably the most realistic pathway to a shorter swing. He still has incredible twitch for a prospect his size and has a shot to have both plus-plus raw power and speed at maturity (only one is projected here), plus it's probably worth trying to develop Griffin in center field. The more he focuses solely on that, the better his feel for the outfield could become."

He hit .311/.390/.485 in his first full season, another of the Rockies' recent college draftees who put up monster numbers at hitter-friendly Spokane in 2024. Karros is very likely not <em>that</em> good a hitter. He's a stiff-legged athlete whose upright manner of swinging leaves him very vulnerable to secondary stuff at the bottom of the zone. Karros' carrying tool is his third base defense. He's not explosive or rangy, but he's incredibly smooth and capable of making great throws from all kinds of odd platforms. It's important for Karros to add strength to his 6-foot-5 frame, as he needs to develop power to counter a below-average contact projection. That and the introduction of other corner positions on defense are key developmental variables to watch as Karros treks toward a four corners bench role."

He K'd at a 25% clip at Low-A and a 31.4% rate at High-A. Rincon went to the Arizona Fall League after the regular season to pick up some of the reps he lost due to the hamstring injury and continued to struggle there. He was at or under the Mendoza Line all year when he was healthy enough to play. How much of this was rust, or related to discomfort and tightness that preceded the IL stint, and how much is related to Rincon's talent? His underlying contact rates dipped from 88% in-zone and 81% overall in 2023 to 81% in-zone and 74% overall in 2024. Rincon looked better at shortstop the further away he got from his hamstring injury, and was good there in the AFL, but the same was not true of his hitting hands, which were still a little slow and stiff. A year ago, it looked like Rincon would have the skill set of a Geraldo Perdomo type of second division regular.

He was a young-for-the-class catcher with a great looking swing. Luciano's whole body is well-connected throughout his swing, and his hands work with natural loft and impressive thump for a hitter his age. He's shown feel for tucking his hands in to handle pitches on the inner half of the plate, though Luciano wasn't a showcase fixture and until postseason developmental activity in Arizona, he just hadn't seen very much pro-quality pitching. As you can imagine, this extends to Luciano's defense, which is sushi raw. He has above-average arm strength but needs to improve his accuracy. The rest of Luciano's defense is in its infancy, but he only turned 18 a few days before Thanksgiving 2024, so that's totally fine. He's a slow-developing catcher prospect with uncommon offensive upside."

FA,Cooper,Ingle,,CLE,,,,50,Med,23.1,60.0,60.0,35.0,50.0,"Ingle is one of the twitchier athletes in the minors, with his quickness impacting the game in many different ways. This has been the case for Ingle on offense for a while. He was an excellent contact hitter at Clemson and he's carried that ability seamlessly into pro ball. Of compact build, Ingle can wait forever before he decides whether or not to swing. He's a count-working nightmare who spoils a ton of tough pitches and sprays line drive contact all over the field. In 2024, Ingle slashed .305/.419/.478 at mostly High-A. He walked more than he struck out and kept hitting even after he was promoted to Double-A Akron later in the year. 
The key developments for Ingle in 2024 involved his physique and defense. He has always been on the smaller side of what is typical for a big league catcher, and while that remains true, he has added 15 pounds or so and is noticeably stockier than when he signed. The added strength has made Ingle a much quieter receiver and it hasn't cost him any quickness; he is incredibly agile and it shows in his blocking and the way he exits his crouch. Ingle's arm strength is only fair, so he needs to get rid of the baseball as quickly as possible, and he does. His accuracy can suffer because of his haste, but overall this approach worked for Ingle in 2024, as he's hosed 26% of would-be base stealers and trended better after he was promoted to Akron. It's still fair to wonder how Ingle's body will hold up against the rigors of catching most days at the big league level (he caught 74 games in 2024), but he now has the skills to play the position well, and his combination of contact and on-base ability should be enough for him to clear the offensive bar at his position."

Johnson has precocious power; he lacks big physical projection but already has meaningful pop. His bat path is vertical, and he has a good chance to actualize in-game power. Johnson can awkwardly roll over his feet and ankles and lose balance in the box; scouts are mixed in their hit tool projection for him. Johnson is a volatile but talented power-hitting infield prospect on par with a mid-second rounder. He signed for $1.5 million in January 2025."

Cruz was born in the D.R. but went to high school in South Florida and showed impressive raw power at the Draft Combine in Phoenix (though he was one of the event's slower runners). Cruz’s frame is very wiry and projectable, and he could have plus raw pop down the road. His combination of present juice and long-term physical projection is exciting, but we simply don't know a ton about his contact ability right now. He wasn't a showcase fixture and didn't play complex-level ball after the draft; he didn't take the field until postseason developmental activity, where no stats are kept. Cruz fires his hands low, which we think limits his ability to cover the middle-up part of the zone, especially against fastballs. How he develops in this area is key because we think he'll end up at third base due to a lack of range. Cruz has soft hands on the dirt and enough arm for the left side of the infield, but it’s not a quick-twitch operation and his lateral range might deteriorate as his frame matures. This is a very high-variance prospect with power as his carrying tool."

Built in the Daniel Murphy and Nolan Schanuel mold, Thompson isn't an especially mobile athlete, and he has trended down the defensive spectrum during the last few years from 2B/3B to 1B/LF, where he isn't particularly sound. Thompson has great hands in the batter's box, his pretty swing generates airborne contact from pole to pole, and he does not miss mistakes. He's going to actualize the power he has, but it will only be fair pop unless something about his physicality changes drastically in his mid-20s. Now a career .270/.345/.430 hitter in the minors, Thompson has a roughly average contact and power combination undercut a bit by a lack of plate discipline. It's enough to consider him a high-probability platoon piece, but not enough to consider him a foundational everyday player at the positions he's capable of playing."

South Carolina Ballcocks,Sebastian,Walcott,,TEX,17.0,21.0,,60,High,19.0,45.0,40.0,70.0,45.0,"Walcott was seen some in the U.S. during the fall of 2021, and he leapt off the field because of his physicality and power. The Rangers international scouting group was originally connected to a player named Camilo Diaz for a rumored bonus of $3 million, but seemingly diverted to Walcott around this time (Diaz later signed with Houston). Walcott signed in January of 2023 and immediately stood apart from his peers on the backfields because of his size and bat speed. He went to the D.R. for the start of the 2023 DSL season, but was quickly promoted to Arizona and lit up the ACL up for a month (he was hondo'd at this time) before opponents realized he couldn't recognize a breaking ball. He ended up having a .273/.325/.524 line in Arizona with terrifying peripherals, including a 6.4% walk rate and 32.5% strikeout rate. In 2024, the Rangers sent Walcott, who turned 18 during spring training, straight to High-A Hickory. Amazingly, he held his own there, slashing .261/.342/.443 with 10.6% walks (sigh of relief) and 25.5% strikeouts before earning a promotion to Double-A Frisco for the final week of the season. 
As you are reading this Top 100 blurb, Walcott is still just 18 years old. He has immense physical ability, a cathedral ceiling, and the long-term athletic projection to be very good for a very long time. He looks like a future NFL wide receiver in his uniform and has elite hand speed in the batter's box, which he generates with shockingly little effort for a hitter his age. There are some mechanical flaws and nits to pick with Walcott's swing, but when you're this talented, these tend not to matter. Walcott's front side often opens up toward third base when he swings, leaving him very vulnerable to sliders away from him. His tendency to chase and miss against secondary stuff is still kind of scary, but his fastball swing decisions are very good, and overall, his baseline chase and two-strike chase were about the big league average in 2024. His bat path slopes down and tends to swat the baseball into the ground, unless Walcott is making contact way out in front of the plate, at which point those of you in the parking lot need to keep your head on a swivel. Despite his issues, Walcott is generating plus big league peak exit velos as a freaking 18-year-old, and just had a 125 wRC+ season in the mid-minors even though the paint on many aspects of his game is still wet. His stride direction might require eventual adjustment, but rather than intervene right now, I think it's fine to see if Walcott's timing and feel to hit come naturally once he's challenged. 
By the end of the season, Walcott had also leveled up on defense. He lacks the footspeed and twitch of most big league shortstops, but his ability to bend at his size is amazing, and Walcott's short arm stroke (reminiscent of Manny Machado's) allows him to effortlessly send the baseball wherever it needs to go. His actions and exchange on slow rollers have also improved. By the end of the season, Walcott (who still has some accuracy hiccups) did not seem sped up or flustered by the speed of the game on defense like he had early in the season. Walcott's ceiling as a power hitter is as big as any prospect in the minors, and of the players close to him, he pretty comfortably has the best chance at remaining at what is arguably the most valuable position in baseball. This guy is easily the odds on favorite to be the top prospect in baseball a year from now, and he's a grade of breaking ball recognition away from being a 70 FV talent."

He's a fiery on-field leader who has improved on defense during the last several seasons. When the Diamondbacks first got Cerda, he was a pretty awful receiver and ball-blocker, but he's gotten much better at both over the last couple of years. He has great lateral agility whether he's catching on one knee or from a traditional crouch; Cerda uses the latter with runners on base. Cerda has above-average arm strength and below-average arm accuracy right now. He's on track to have a glove-first backup profile because his best offensive skill is his plate discipline. Though his torso rotates like the head of an owl in the batter's box, Cerda hasn't produced much game power. He hasn't been striking out very much, but he lacks deft barrel accuracy and misses a fair bit in the zone. He might strike out more as he accrues upper level reps and opposing arms realize they don't have to nibble to get Cerda out. Young enough to add a little more strength and power, Cerda is tracking like a solid backup."

Mayea looked like a speedy, glove-first center field prospect in his debut season. Last list cycle, I compared him to Albert Almora or Manny Margot, but he K'd too much in 2024 for those comparisons to continue. Mayea's footwork in the box is often poorly timed, and his hands load deep and late, causing him to push an inordinate amount of contact the opposite way when he's able to make it. His speed and defense are both plus, as Mayea puts down some jailbreak times in the 4.1s, and his reads and routes are decisive and polished. He currently looks like a glove-oriented fifth outfielder and probably needs a swing adjustment to be more."

Carlos Beltrán's nephew moved to the outfield full-time in 2024 and it appeared as though a swing change unlocked an extra gear of power for him, as Lugo hit 17 home runs (one shy of his career high) in just 79 games. Lugo's hands are setting up earlier than before, and the path they take to load has changed. His mistake-crushing style had him on pace to hit 30 homers in the minors before he was shut down with a thumb injury after just one game in the Angels org. 
Always geared for pull-side lift, there hasn't been a dramatic change to Lugo's batted ball profile, but he hit the ball harder last year and chased less. Hell-bent on pulling the baseball, Lugo struggles to cover the outer third of the zone and swings inside of a ton of pitches out there. Given his projected hit tool limitations (his contact rates were average in 2024, but this eval thinks his approach will make it tough to sustain that) and the way his defensive versatility has trended down, he looks more like an above-replacement up/down outfielder than a consistent role player. This is a well-built young athlete who'll probably play high-level pro baseball for quite a while, and if he can successfully revisit the infield during that time, then we're talking about a more rosterable player."

Lewisberg All Blacks,Robert,Calaz,,COL,,,,40+,Med,19.4,30.0,40.0,55.0,40.0,"Calaz had among the best present raw power in the 2023 international signing class and he has reinforced that assessment so far in pro ball, as he has 19 homers in 105 career games and has posted peak exit velocities (113 mph max, 109 EV90) that would be plus on the big league scale, let alone for a teenage hitter. He clubbed his way off the complex in 2024, spending the final three weeks of the season at Low-A Fresno, and is now a career .336/.436/.603 hitter with 54 extra-base hits in 105 mostly rookie-level games. 
The power aspect of Calaz's profile is for real. Perhaps what is most absurd is how much thump he can generate without a leg kick — he starts with a very wide stance and uses just a little toe tap to get going. A very loose athlete, Calaz rotates with verve and ferocity, but in order to do so, his hips often clear very early, leaving him vulnerable to sliders away from him. This is a pretty serious issue already. Calaz ran a paltry 66% contact rate in 2024, worse than all but one qualified big leaguer (Zack Gelof). There are a handful of very toolsy whiff-prone power hitters in that contact rate area, including Christopher Morel and Logan O'Hoppe, both of whom are sound build/frame comps for Calaz. And Calaz projects to have raw power similar to other players in that group, like Brent Rooker and Adolis García. There's 35-homer ceiling here, but there's also a lot of bust risk because of how many rookie-level strikeouts we're talking about."

He had a strikeout-prone pro debut, K'ing about 33% of the time in the DSL. Vilorio's physical prowess is sufficient to keep him on the main section of the prospect list despite his red flag contact performance, though his grade has obviously dropped way below his pre-signing 40+ FV mark. Vilorio's hands are still incredibly powerful, and he shows feel for all-fields contact when he's able to put his bat on the ball. A tendency to chase exacerbated his issues last year. He needs to show improvement in this area in 2025 to stay on here."

FA,Devin,Saltiban,,PHI,,,,35+,High,20.1,30.0,30.0,55.0,60.0,"It's logistically difficult for Hawaiian position player prospects to travel to the mainland for a ton of showcase activity, so it was Saltiban's showing in the 2023 MLB Draft League and that year's Draft Combine that first put him on FanGraphs' radar. The Phillies gave him a little over $600,000 to sign. 
I had Saltiban written up as an outfielder prior to the draft because he didn't seem to have the hands for the infield. Given his relative lack of experience, it made sense for the Phillies to at least see if he could develop as an infielder, so he played shortstop after signing and second base in 2024. He's still too mistake-prone to consider a viable infield prospect, but Saltiban is a plus runner and I think his best chance of playing an up-the-middle position is to deploy him in center field. 
Saltiban is built like a little running back and has an exciting power/speed combo, which allowed him to hit 17 bombs in Clearwater last year, a couple of which went out to the opposite field. He has a very authoritative top hand through contact and is capable of turning on fastballs up around his hands, but he struggles to recognize sliders. Saltiban is perhaps the highest variance prospect in this system. There's a chance he doesn't make enough contact to be anything at all, but there's also a chance he's a 20-homer center fielder in spite of a ton of strikeouts. Because his position is still totally up in the air, Saltiban remains more of a toolsy dev project than a true impact prospect, even though he has that kind of ceiling."

Southisene plays with undeniable energy and hustle. He's short, ultra-twitchy little guy with a rhythmic swing, a hand hitch trigger, average bat speed, and a pretty extreme opposite field tendency, which we worry means he's late to the contact point. Southisense controls his body well on defense and should be a viable defender at shortstop, but our hit tool concerns keep him down with the other toolsy little guys at the bottom of the system."

He was viewed as one of the few prospects from the 2024 IFA class with a chance to do at least a little bit of everything (and a lot of some things), and he was also one of the youngest. He played 34 games between both of Arizona’s DSL clubs and slashed .225/.331/.288 with 25 strikeouts (19.2%) and 14 walks (10.8%) over 130 plate appearances. More notably, Radney didn’t produce a single homer over the summer and only had five extra base hits total. He was dealing with a back issue all summer, which may have limited his output on both sides of the ball (he didn't play center field in 2024). 
Radney still showcases impressive bat speed, but his downward path creates issues getting the ball off of the ground (53% groundball rate last year). He's going to repeat the DSL in 2025. We still love the athleticism, projection, and bat speed here and think it's encouraging that Radney didn't strike out a ton even though he was apparently compromised. Before he signed, Radney was evaluated like a draft's top 10 pick; now he's graded as if he's more of a late first rounder as we wait to see if his debut was an injury-influenced blip or not."

Centreville Blue Sox,Zyhir,Hope,,LAD,74.0,51.0,,45+,High,18.8,40.0,35.0,60.0,60.0,"Hope was traded to the Dodgers as part of the Michael Busch deal before 2024 spring training, just six months after he was selected as the Cubs’ 2023 11th-round pick. He then missed most of the first half of the 2024 season with a shoulder injury and was limited to just 61 regular season games before he picked up reps in the Arizona Fall League. He slashed .287/.415/.490 in 248 PA at Rancho Cucamonga and then .228/.301/.446 in 103 PA in Arizona. Hope has enormous all-fields power and incredible speed for an athlete his size, but his Low-A and AFL strikeouts (25% K%), combined with his poor defensive feel, create risk that Hope is a strikeout-prone LF/DH. 
Hope was a speed-oriented high school prospect but has become tremendously strong since turning pro, and he's able to generate big power in a short mechanical distance. His 2024 peak exit velocities were comfortably plus on the big league scale; during Fall League, I watched him hit a 470-foot homer one day and then fight off a 97 mph fastball for an oppo homer the next. I believe there is still volatile hit tool risk here. Hope's head is often flying all over the place when he swings, and you can get him out if you execute to the top of the strike zone. Though his underlying regular season contact data in 2024 was quite positive, it was generated in less than half a season of Low-A plate appearances, and against the Cal League pitchers who weren't promoted to High-A for the second half. I'm not inclined to take it at face value, and instead want to lean on my eyes, which are telling me there's K risk here. Hope's feel for defense is also not good right now. It's possible this is simply due to a lack of pro reps, but if it remains this way then Hope will be a below-average LF, or a DH. His added size has given him tremendous power, Hope's lower body has grown like the Grinch's heart during the last twelve-plus months and he's still very fast for an athlete his size, but it's tough to predict how Hope's mobility will trend into his mid-20s when he's already this big at this age.
Hope's power is so big, that if he can maintain even a 25-28% K%, he'll get to enough pop to be good no matter what he's doing on defense. A Kyle Schwarber-y outcome like that is possible here. Currently sitting just outside the Top 100, Hope has just about half a season of A-ball plate appearances to his name and is likely to be a bottom-of-the-spectrum defender, so let's see if can sustain a viable level of contact against mid-minors pitching in a full season before declaring him a middle-of-the-order lock."

His underlying exit velos from 2024 are pretty underwhelming, but they're still just shy of the average among big league shortstops (his contact rates are comfortably above) and were probably impacted by his wrist. 
Young does enough on defense to project as a viable shortstop. His hands and exchange are sound, while his arm strength is right on the fringe on what's permissible on the left side. He's performed on offense even as he and the Mariners have made changes to his swing, which now includes a lower load. Young also grinds out tough at-bats. He has great plate discipline, spoils tough two-strike pitches, and tends to put the ball in play even when he chases. If he shows up to camp healthy this spring, there's a chance he grabs hold of the Mariners everyday second base job at some point in 2025. He's a low-variance everyday middle infield prospect who is unlikely to be a star."

FA,Gino,Groover,,ARI,,,,45,Med,23.0,50.0,55.0,45.0,55.0,"Groover spent his freshman season at UNC Wilmington (Nate Furman, David McCabe, and Jake Cunningham were teammates) before transferring to NC State, where he raked for two years (259 total bases in 114 career games) and became one of the more interesting prospects in the 2023 draft. Groover's prospect case was very strong on paper (he had a rare blend of high-end contact rates and measurable power) but was spottier in more subjective, visual ways (he was a mistake-prone third base defender with kind of a weird swing, but rare hand speed). Groover entered 2024 as a Pick to Click, but he never really got the chance to, as he fractured his wrist in a collision with a baserunner during the first week of the season and missed several months. He returned in late July, hit well for a little over a month at High-A Hillsboro, and finished his year with a couple weeks at Amarillo and then the Arizona Fall League. 
After 88 career minor league games, Groover is hitting .281/.362/.450 with a 10% career strikeout rate. He is short to the baseball and most dangerous against pitches on the inner third of the plate, which he can pull with authority. His style of hitting might leave him vulnerable to better breaking balls on the outer half, but so far Groover has been able to spoil these pitches. His measured power was unimpressive in 2024, but he was coming off a wrist fracture, so it's fine to mostly ignore this. Matt Vierling presents a pretty good comp for the way Groover both swings and is projected to produce on offense. 
Like Vierling, Groover is a native third baseman who has not always looked capable of playing there, and he began branching out on defense in 2024 with reps at both first base (where he got hurt, and then didn't play again until the Fall League) and the keystone. Groover has improved at third and is getting rid of the baseball quicker on the subset of plays he has historically struggled to make cleanly. Rather than airmail some tough throws, he's throwing accurate one- and two-hoppers over there as quickly as he can, and it's working. It looks like Groover's going to be capable of playing all three spots, while also crushing lefties and matching up well against righties whose stuff tends to live in his happy zone. He projects as a complementary regular who gets 400 or so annual plate appearances at multiple positions."

He signed for $2.8 million and has had a chaotic two years in rookie ball, slashing .247/.323/.488 across those two seasons amid pretty serious strikeout issues and two team-instituted suspensions for taking unannounced in-season trips back to the Dominican Republic. 
Valdez has absurd bat speed in a vacuum, not just for a player his age and size. His ball-in-play data (55% hard-hit rate, 111 mph max exit velocity, 106 mph EV90) is nutty for a teenage shortstop prospect. This kind of ability is freaky enough to keep Valdez on the main section of the list even though he otherwise has a lot of growing to do both on and off the field. He has a wreckless approach at the dish and chases a ton, which is largely why his strikeout rates are already in a red flag zone even though he's in rookie ball. It's going to be fascinating to watch this guy's career unfold because Valdez has so much talent that he'll likely keep being given opportunities even if everything about him continues to be choppy."

He'll run into a few mistakes down the middle of the plate, but he's a bottom of the scale contact hitter. He's as allergic to sliders as a homeschooled zoomer is to nuts, missing them at a 47% rate.

He entered pro ball as a dynamic, old school leadoff hitter prospect, and so far that's exactly what he looks like. Clark spent most of his first full pro season at Low-A Lakeland and was promoted to High-A West Michigan for the final month and a half of 2024. In 107 combined games, he slashed .279/.372/.421 and tallied 36 extra-base hits and 29 steals in 33 attempts. 
Clark's lightning-quick hitting hands are best at snatching pitches around the top of the strike zone. He slices and hooks lots of hard, low-lying contact from line to line, then uses his speed to take extra bases. His swing doesn't feature big lift, and Clark lacks overt, frame-based power projection, but the amount of contact he makes and its quality should enable him to hit for plenty of in-game power in pro ball — it will just likely manifest as 40 or 50 doubles rather than 30-plus home runs. 
Clark still has some developing to do in center field. He easily has the speed to play the position well, but he often looks uncomfortable at the catch point. None of Clark's underlying data is particularly nutty when compared to big league averages, but it's impressive across the board for an up-the-middle player his age. He's still tracking like a traditional leadoff-hitting center fielder with a well-rounded game."

FA,Tai,Peete,,SEA,,,,50,High,19.6,40.0,40.0,60.0,55.0,"Peete was a 2024 Pick to Click who has clicked for an unexpected reason: It looks like he's going to make a successful transition to center field. A high school shortstop whose size likely would have been a prohibitive long-term factor at that position, Peete was error-prone at short in 2024 and, in the middle of the season, the Mariners shifted him to the outfield on a part-time basis. It's not as if Peete instantly became Kevin Kiermaier out there, but his first step and range were surprisingly good. Like Lourdes Gurriel Jr., Peete has taken some of his infielder skills out there with him, and his exchange on throws is uncommonly quick. Unsurprisingly, his routes need some polish, but Peete boldly made some spectacular plays out there last season. He's already better in the outfield than he is at short, where errors of all sorts were common for him in 2024. Part of me wants Peete to keep playing some infield, if only so that he keeps having opportunities to handle the baseball as much as possible as a way of improving his hands, but part of me wants to see the Mariners commit to the center field thing full-time. 
Of course, the reason I thought Peete would break out in 2024 is because of his immense, frame-driven power potential. He has an ideal baseball player's build at a broad-shouldered 6-foot-2, and he put on an absolute show during BP at the 2023 Combine. He came to pro ball with hit tool risk, and that still exists. He posted a 67% contact rate in 2024 and still struggles to cover the outer third of the zone because of how early his front side drifts open. But despite Peete's lever length, he's often on time to pull. It's kind of amazing how often he's able to snatch pitches riding in on his hands, and he showed glimpses last year of being able to bend at the waist so that he can cover that outer edge with power. He's still growing into his body and should add more raw juice as he matures. He made the 100 more on upside than certainly, as he has a shot to be a 25-homer center fielder."

As he enters his age-25 season, Carreras remains rather thin and has plateaued with gap doubles power, which he struggles to get to because he tends to chase. It's the skill set of a glove-only nine-hole hitter. On a good roster, Carreras would be used as a defensive replacement."

One of the most exciting 2025 international amateurs, Tornes generates some Anthony Santander comps and signed for just under $2.5 million in January. 
Tornes' lefty swing requires little mechanical runway to generate lethal bat speed. His stride back towards the pitcher occupies a lot of the batter's box, but he doesn't use a big leg kick to get there. The strength and explosion in Tornes' hands is special and, unlike a lot of other hitters his size, it doesn't take an elaborate operation to generate. His right-handed swing isn't as explosive, and there are scouts who think he should just be hitting left-handed. If there's a nit to pick with this top-of-the-class talent, it's that Tornes' bat path isn't in the hitting zone for an especially long time. Tornes' conditioning also waxed and waned during the time between his verbal commitment and signing day, and he's likely a left field fit on defense long-term. He has the talent to hit his way into the middle of a big league order one day, and looks like the kind of high schooler who goes in the top half of the draft's first round."

In Triantos' case, the pandemic made it hard for him to accumulate such a sample, and yet the Cubs boldly gave him just over $2 million to sign as a second rounder rather than go to Virginia. Triantos has more or less run the minor league table as a plus or better contact hitter with all-fields doubles power. He's now reached Triple-A and sports a .289/.349/.417 career minor league line. He's been among the best pure contact hitters in the minors since he turned pro and has bounced around the 45-50 FV range the last couple of years as his defensive home has gotten sorted out. 
For a while he looked so rough at 2B/3B that he seemed destined for LF/DH, but the further and further Triantos has gotten from a 2023 meniscus injury, the better he has looked at second. He has below-average hands, but he's in his physical prime and as rangey and mobile as he's ever been, and should be able to play there. He has also been given reps in center field, and while he's a surprisingly fast runner given some of his other athletic limitations, the position is a stretch for him. We speculatively have left field as part of his future mix. Triantos doesn't have the power of a first division second baseman, so versatility should be part of his game; he can't handle the hot shots at third base, so left field it is.
Let's not lose sight of the apple here — Triantos can really hit. He has great bat control and his best swings have huge finish behind him, though he's definitely looser than he is explosive. Capable of pulling up-and-in pitches with power, Triantos is a line drive singles hitter in the bulk of the zone. He's a proactive swinger but isn't so chase prone that it threatens to sabatoge his overall production. The 2025 season will be Triantos' 40-man platform year. Whether he can play first base or left field might dictate whether he's easy to roster or necessary to trade."

East Carolina Bucs,Druw,Jones,,ARI,,,,40+,High,21.3,30.0,30.0,45.0,55.0,"Various injuries (a post-draft labrum tear, and quad and hamstring issues the following year) prevented Jones from being healthy enough to play consistently until 2024, when he hit .275/.409/.405 to go with a 28% strikeout rate and 18% walk rate in 109 Cal League games. It's good that Jones was actually able to play, stayed off the IL all year, and had a productive surface-level performance, which was good for a 125 wRC+. But Jones still has some pretty serious issues hitting. He remains wholly unable to pull the baseball due to the length of his swing. When Jones was in high school, this seemed like a quirk that could be ironed out in pro ball; instead, it has turned into a concerning issue. Jones is often overwhelmed by fastballs because he's too late to the contact point, and even when he's not, he often drives the ball into the ground. Jones posted a 57.2% groundball rate in 2024, which would have tied for the eighth-highest GB% among big league hitters with 100 PA. 
Before he was drafted, it was reasonably assumed that Jones would be able to shorten up his swing as he filled out and got stronger, but that hasn't happened. Though he had a softer, less sinewy build than most elite high school-aged prospects, he was a big-framed guy who was already hitting the ball really hard for his age. It seemed like he might suddenly have enormous power and a more functional swing on a pro strength program, but he has been treading water in these areas. Of course, even though Jones had a healthy 2024, he's still missed the majority of his potential pro at-bats due to injury, which might explain why all of this stuff is so far behind. We can all cross our fingers that this is true, but it doesn't change the reality of Jones' scouting report right now; he has a huge hole in his swing at the top of the zone. 
He remains a good defensive center fielder, especially at the catch point. Jones does some ridiculous stuff adjusting and contorting his body to make spectacular plays, though his range and route quality are more average, and are sometimes why he's forced to do Spiderman stuff. All is not lost here, but at age 21, there are so many aspects of Jones' game that need to develop that it'd be unreasonable to expect that all of them will. A hopeful but level-headed projection for him at this point is a career like Michael A. Taylor's, where Jones gets to enough power and plays great enough defense to have a long career as a fourth outfielder with a season or two peaking above that."

He became enormously strong over the year or so leading up to the 2025 signing day, and he puts on quite a show during BP. Rodriguez has plus power right now and is very likely grow into even more as he keeps filling out. His is a turbo-charged right field profile with enormous power and arm strength, akin to a high school player who would go in the mid-to-late first round of any given draft. His hit tool and contact ability garner mixed reviews from scouts, as his lever length and opposite-field tendency might be an issue against pro velo. A corner-only fit on defense combined with hit tool risk creates a low floor for the profile, but 30-plus homer upside exists if Rodriguez can actually hit. Tigers fans have heard this refrain before, as many of their recent high-profile signees are K-prone corner guys, but while Rodriguez shares this sort of risk, he has a different level of physical projection than the others."

Combined between the two levels, Laverde slashed .294/.371/.406 with 22 extra-base hits in 75 games. There are other position player prospects who have a better chance to remain at their up-the-middle position than Laverde, but one could argue Laverde has more offensive potential by a good bit. He has plus lefty bat speed with natural pull-side loft and enough barrel control to manifest that power in games. His stocky build lacks great long-term physical projection (Omar Narváez and Tucker Barnhart are pretty good body comps), but Laverde already has good offensive tools for a catching prospect. 
His arm strength is fine, but his accuracy, receiving, ball-blocking, and some of the other more subtle aspects of catching (Laverde's posture and early crouch often tip what pitch type is coming) will have to develop if he is going to stick behind the plate. All of that stuff is below average but not so bad that he's less than a 50/50 chance to stay back there; his foundation as a defender is strong enough to project him to remain at catcher. As is always the case with teenage catchers, Laverde is a risky prospect who will likely take a while to develop.

The bad: He's been rail thin for basically his whole career and has yet to get any stronger. Sanchez's 2024 statline was pretty terrible, but Tri-City is a horrible place to hit. Sanchez's lefty swing is beautiful and pure, and he can pull pitches on the inner third with power. It may end up being sexier looking than it is functional against big league velocity, but it's a good enough reason to stay on Sanchez as a prospect to some extent. His underlying contact numbers are a bit better than average, and Sanchez's build and bodily looseness indicate athletic longevity.

Wrigleyville Fielders,Moises,Ballesteros,,CHC,68.0,62.0,,45,Med,21.4,50.0,50.0,50.0,20.0,"Ballesteros is a husky catcher who signed for $1.2 million back in 2021 as a bat-first prospect who needed substantial development as a defender. He's raked as he's climbed the minors (he's posted a .279/.366/.452 career line and has reached Triple-A), and though he still isn't an ironclad catching defender, Ballesteros has improved enough back there to maintain projection at the position. 
Ballesteros' best defensive attribute is his arm accuracy. He doesn't have an all-world hose, but he has a surprisingly quick release for a guy his size and throws a lot of accurate one-hoppers to second in the 1.95-2.00 second range, sometimes from his knees. His receiving has improved to a place of viability, but his ball-blocking, especially to his left, mostly has not. Though this problem was much more pronounced during the 2024 Arizona Fall League than it was during the regular season, it's an issue that might prevent him from catching pitchers whose stuff is apt to expose his issues, and in his particular case that means guys whose stuff tends to finish in the dirt. 
Were Ballesteros more of a lock to catch, then he'd have a great argument to be in the Top 100 because he pretty comfortably hits enough to profile as a primary catcher. As a part-time first baseman or DH, though, he falls a tad short — literally. At just 5-foot-8 and built like Alejandro Kirk, Ballesteros lacks the typical physicality and power of a big league 1B/DH. He has roughly average raw power and zero physical projection; his body is maxed out and it'd be surprising if he got much stronger even though he's still only 21. While Ballesteros is a good all-fields contact hitter and great at making inflight adjustments to breaking stuff, he has become more and more chase prone against high fastballs as he's climbed the minors. His 36% chase rate against fastballs is way above what's typical for hitters generally, let alone against fastballs that tend to have lower chase rates than pitch types more often meant to make hitters go fishing. His chase against other pitch types is more typical. 
This forecast for Ballesteros rounds down on his offense a bit more than last list cycle, and puts him in more of an average contact and power territory with potentially below-average on base skills looming as he faces more and more quality fastballs. Combine that with a potentially short timeline of athletic viability, and Ballesteros looks more like a solid part-time player who catches once a week and gets a couple starts against righties, which should still allow him to amass 300-400 annual plate appearances of roughly average offense. The 2025 season is Ballesteros' 40-man platform year, and the Cubs have acquired veteran catching that now slides him down the current catching depth chart. If he can improve as a defender, then perhaps he'll be the Cubs' best option behind the dish at some point in 2025, but for now he looks more likely to debut in 2026."
Fairfax Flying Squirrels,Daniel,Susac,,ATH,,,,40,High,23.9,35.0,40.0,45.0,30.0,"Susac spent all of 2024 in Midland, where he posted a respectable .257/.300/.434 line despite chasing over 40% of the time. His inability to parse balls and strikes is extreme. Susac had 370 trips to the plate last season and only walked 16 times (4.3%), and though he has pretty good plate coverage, he still struck out at a 25.9% clip because of all the chase. Susac's power is still pretty good for a catcher and he tallied 34 extra-base hits on the year, but it's tough to expect him to get to his power in games when he's expanding the zone this much. Behind the dish, Susac moves around well and is a relatively quiet pitch receiver. His ball-blocking still needs a lot of work and his exit from his crouch is inconsistent and impacts his pop times, which are fine when he has a clean exchange. He's a flawed third catcher at this point."

Like a lot of college hitters, he enjoyed a huge uptick in power output in 2024, clubbing 14 homers and doubling his career total in the process. Waldschmidt had an OPS north of 1.000 and performed well in several key statistical categories at Kentucky, including plate discipline, contact, and measurable power. He had one of the more well-rounded statistical cases of any college hitter in the 2024 draft. 
Visual evaluation of Waldschmidt's hit tool comes in south of his data. His swing is hellacious but atypical. He takes a really healthy hack but does so with basically no stride. Waldschmidt's swing is all hands and torso, and requires a ton of effort, so much that his head kicks around and he often loses sight of the baseball as his body ignites. His hardest swings are truly over in the blink of an eye, like a cobra strike — this guy has big time bat speed and power that plays best (by far) against pitches down-and-in. If he can sustain this approach all the way up the minors, we're talking about a LF/DH who's in the lineup every day. The left field-only profile puts Waldschmidt on thin ice if he can't, in which case, we'd be looking at a Clint Frazier type outcome."

He is built like Michael Irvin and has an enormous power ceiling if he fills out the way we think he will. In 2024, when he moved from the infield to the outfield, De La Cruz slashed .301/.399/.435 with 32 walks (14.3%) and 46 strikeouts (20.5%) over 224 complex-level plate appearances, but he didn't hit a single homer. Despite his lever length, De La Cruz is fairly adept at staying short to the inner third of the zone and making contact in there, though he often strides toward the third base line in order to do this and might be vulnerable to well-located sliders as he climbs. His swing generates all-fields spray, including a lot of inside-outed contact to right field. For such a lanky hitter, this sort of performance is atypical. De La Cruz's power needs to start showing up in games because he's likely ticketed for a corner outfield spot. There are too many good center fielders in the org for him to get regular reps there, and he's new to the outfield and predictably raw. A long-term prospect because of his long-term power projection, De La Cruz has the look and feel of a toolsy junior college prospect who gets drafted in the third or fourth round."

FA,Yahil,Melendez,,CHC,,,,40,High,19.6,50.0,40.0,45.0,40.0,"Melendez signed for $400,000 as a seventh rounder rather than go to Rice, and he's one of quite a few interesting young hitters who were part of Chicago's Arizona complex group in 2024, slashing .268/.395/.425 with 19 extra-base hits in 53 games. Melendez already has some of the most exciting power in the Cubs org. He has slightly above-average measurable raw pop already as a teenager (he turned 19 just after the season), he has rare size for a potential shortstop at a strapping 6-foot-3, and he also has an unusually compact swing and shorter levers than most hitters this size do. 
Melendez isn't the bendiest athlete and plays the game with a high center of gravity, which is evident both in his swing and on defense. This limits his ability to reach a lot of softer stuff in the bottom of he zone, which we worry will be a growing issue as he climbs. Melendez's bat path just doesn't allow him to scoop these pitches; he either needs to change that or get deeper into his lower body to connect with them, and it makes flexibility the key visual piece of Melendez's evaluation to monitor. This issue extends to Melendez's defense. At his size, he may not be a long-term fit at short no matter what, but his hands and feel for defense have improved during his year-and-a-half of pro ball. He's a pessimistic ""maybe"" at short. 
Lefty-hitting infielders with this kind of power projection don't exactly grow on trees, but Melendez is volatile because of the hole in his swing, and he struck out quite a bit on the complex (28.4%). He has the upside that we'd typically associate with 40+ FV prospect, but the third base and strikeout risk here has us rounding down a touch."

FA,Cole,Carrigg,,COL,,85.0,,40+,Med,22.9,40.0,40.0,45.0,55.0,"Carrigg is a unique multi-positional prospect, a fair switch-hitter with some low ball pop from the left side of the plate and an all-world arm. He slashed .283/.359/.491 with 17 homers in his first full pro season, spent mostly at High-A Spokane. Both visual scouting and a data-oriented assessment of Carrigg as a hitter have him more average (contact) or a shade below (raw power). Both of Carrigg's swings are geared for pull and lift (he has a pretty classic low-ball stroke as a lefty), and he'll be able to get to relevant (if modest) power. 
The Rockies deployed Carrigg behind the plate a little bit right after he turned pro, but he spent most of 2024 in center field, with infrequent starts at shortstop. A long-striding runner, Carrigg has plus speed underway but takes a little while to get going. In a year and a half of pro ball, Carrigg has now played twice as many games in center field as he did throughout his three years of college. He was more comfortable out there late in 2024 than he was at the start and should be average there in time. Plus, he brings show-stopping arm strength to the table. The way Carrigg's body unfurls on a max-effort outfield chuck is incredible, though he isn't an accurate infield thrower at all, and it's a big enough issue that he might just be an outfielder. The peak outcome for Carrigg would be a dynamic, Willi Castro-esque utilityman, though he's trending more like a good part-time outfielder whose career might have a relevant second act on the mound."
FA,Kadon,Morton,,ATL,,,,35+,High,24.4,,,,,"Drafted as a high school outfielder in 2019, Morton flamed out as a hitter in 2023 and switched to pitching in 2024. He began the season as a piggyback starter, then moved to the bullpen in late July and worked an inning or two at a time for the rest of the year, accumulating 47.1 total innings. Morton allowed runs in just two of the 10 games he pitched out of the bullpen late in the season, though in each of those he allowed five. 
The raw material Atlanta has to work with here is very, very exciting, and even though Morton wasn't throwing all that hard immediately upon conversion, the potential for growth in this area is substantial because of how gorgeous his delivery is. This is an elite athletic mover on the mound. He has one of the more picturesque deliveries you'll see, and generates seven feet of extension. Morton's fastball features slightly above-average ride and his slider, which generated a 47% miss rate in 2024, has nice two-planed shape. This is still more of an aggressive, somewhat speculative way to line Morton up in this system because he's an A-ball conversion arm with a bloated ERA, but the way this guy moves invites one to dream on his stuff."

Most importantly, Hernandez cut his strikeout rate quite a bit compared to his 2022-23 peak, which was up around 30%; he had a 19% rate after a mid-August promotion to South Bend. Hernandez's swing is still really long. It's whippy and powerful, but Hernandez's feet are all over the place and it's tough for him to time his whole operation. It's going to be a big enough issue to prevent Hernandez from being an everyday shortstop, even though he otherwise has the tools to be. Hernandez is an excellent defender capable of highlight reel plays and throws from deep in the hole, he's physically projectable, and he has big bat speed, but at age 21, he's still a very raw hitter."

Iowa Cubs,Bryce,Rainer,,DET,52.0,60.0,,45+,High,19.7,40.0,40.0,55.0,55.0,"Rainer pitched and played all over the field with high school Team USA, and he was generally seen as pitching prospect until things began to shift in the fall and winter of 2023, when he was suddenly hitting for big power against good varsity prep pitching. He reinforced notions that he had ascended into the middle of the first round as a hitter at 2024 NHSI, and moved up to 10th on the FanGraphs Draft Board. He was drafted 11th overall and got $5.8 million to sign, but he didn't play after the draft.
Rainer has a huge arm, which he showed off at various positions with Team USA (including first base), and this roaming is probably part of why it took him longer to really break out. Rainer sits in the mid-90s on the mound, and has a 70-grade infield arm and an 80-grade arm when he crow hops throws from the outfield. As he's gotten stronger, Rainer has gotten faster, and he still has the footspeed to play short even as he's grown into meaningful power. Rainer's low-ball swing is vulnerable to velocity up and away from him in a significant way, and he had a sub-70% contact rate on the showcase circuit in a nearly 500-pitch sample. He shows very little barrel variability, though he can alter the timing of his footwork to match the pitch type, and his swing has natural loft. He was a Top 100 exclusion as we wait to see how he handles pro-quality pitching. Lefty-hitting shortstops with power like Rainer is likely to have are rare, and he has the upside of an impact, All-Star-level player if it turns out he can actually hit."

Zapata signed for just shy of $1 million and hit .254/.364/.522 in his 2023 DSL debut, but because his underlying contact rates were rather concerning (in the 61-64% range the last two season), he remained in the D.R. for the start of 2024 as well. Zapata was producing there again in 2024 and was promoted to the ACL, where he was clearly overmatched for the final few weeks of the season. Zapata is still not very strong with the bat. He takes a lot of long, awkward swings and looks stiff in the lower body, but he's huge and lanky and has a chance to grow into enormous power and shorten up his swing in the process. He's a high-variance prospect who is still five years or so away, and his contact rates are concerning enough to put Zapata in more of a sleeper/flier FV bucket."

That slash line is a caricature of Matheus' talent, as he's more likely to be a good utilityman than an impact player, but he's a skilled switch-hitter and versatile defender, talented enough to be a relevant prospect even though he's years from the bigs. 
Matheus fits the ""short, but not small"" prospect archetype, as he is very physical and strong for a hitter his size. He hasn't seemed to lose any of his mobility as a result of beefing up, and he has the speed and range to continue to develop at shortstop. On offense, Matheus tracks pitches very well and guides the barrel all over the zone. He's especially adept at staying on breaking balls and putting those into play even when they're not in the zone. Despite his size and strength, Matheus isn't producing high-end exit velocities right now, and he's physically maxed out, so it's difficult to project that he'll develop much more power down the line. This is what limits his perceived ceiling and has him graded as a likely future utility type, one still several levels away."

Long followed that up with an OPS north of 1.000 in the Arizona Fall League. More importantly, he got reps at third base in Arizona. The Cubs are searching for a position for Long, who played both corner infield spots in college and has tried left field in pro ball. He played third more times (10) during the six-week AFL span than he did all regular season (eight). Long is a very tightly-wound athlete who is much more comfortable at first base than those other positions. He lacks the mobility of an average third baseman; he's in same-aged Jake Burger territory in terms of his build and type of athleticism. 
Long is a ferocious in-the-box rotator with plus power. The length of his swing causes him to inside-out a lot of fastballs. He has the juice to do damage that way, but it's concerning how often he is late on mid-minors fastballs such that he's driving them to right field. There isn't a great sample to use as a guide here. Sometimes it's helpful to look at splits versus big league-quality fastball velocities to get a better feel for how a player's contact ability will trend as he climbs, but Long simply didn't face enough 93-plus mph fastballs on tape for that. As such, we're relying more heavily on the look here, and we're pessimistic Long will continue on a 16.7% K%, 10% swinging strike, 75% contact clip. This puts pressure on him to play at least one other position because the contact/power combo for a snug first base fit probably won't be there. He's a prospect in the J.D. Davis mold."

Since entering pro ball, he has been a superlative statistical performer at the lowest domestic levels. Crisantes hit his way off the complex in 2024 and slashed .333/.429/.478 across 63 games at Low-A Visalia. He also had 23 extra-base hits, a strong strikeout-to-walk ratio, and was 20-for-22 on stolen base attempts. 
Crisantes does a lot of little things really well, but he isn't especially toolsy or projectable. He's a fantastic defensive second baseman who plays with a low center of gravity, and he has plus hands and actions. He's also seen time at both corner infield spots, but he has less arm strength than is ideal for third base. Visual evaluation of Crisantes' hit tool comes in south of his data, which is plus. Though his bat path doesn't look like it will be on time against upper-level velocity, he had an 89% in-zone contact rate in 2024 and his swing is geared for loft in an awful lot of the zone for a guy making that much contact. He may not have the offensive output of an impact everyday hitter but should be a core role player who sees 400 PA or so on the right side of the infield."

Though Troy posted a stellar Arizona Fall League statline, he still looked allergic to spin there. He now has a utilityman projection here because it looks unlikely that he's going to hit enough to be an everyday player. Troy can really swing hard and rotates with more explosion than is typical for hitters his size. His scissor-kick swing is geared for banging high fastballs to the opposite field gap but, especially against breaking balls, he isn't on plane with the pitch for very long. Per Synergy, Troy missed 47% of the sliders he swung at in 2024 (reminder: this was at High-A), which is a gigantic spike from his 31% rate at Stanford. For context, Mason Miller's slider had a 48% miss rate in 2024. Troy can crush a fastball, but if he is essentially turning opposing sliders into elite pitches, then big league hurlers aren't going to let him see heaters. Troy now has a pretty extreme power-over-hit offensive profile. His speed is going to add a relevant element to what he brings to a lineup, but his issues with breaking balls are going to make him a streaky hitter at the very least, and on the whole probably it probably won't be enough for him to be an everyday player. 
If there's good news here, it's that Troy has been improving at shortstop. Though he played all over the place at Stanford and looked like he had settled in at third base in his draft year, the Diamondbacks have mostly deployed Troy at short. He's very tightly wound, a much more explosive athlete than an elegant and fluid one, and in the past he struggled with some of the tougher, off-platform throws that big league teams expect their shortstops to make, though he has improved in this regard. He began playing more second base in 2024, especially in the AFL, and based on Troy's look at third base in college, it's reasonable to expect he'll also be able to play there. Troy's speed also gives him a shot to play center field if the D-backs want to give that a try; he played some corner outfield in college but never center. Unless Troy's contact ability miraculously improves in 2025, he isn't on the fast track to the big leagues. He and Arizona have all of 2025 and 2026 to flesh out his fits on defense so that he can compete for a superutility role on the big league roster in 2027."

He hit .268/.345/.404 in 70 games there, and the Cubs sent him straight to High-A South Bend when camp broke in 2024. There Rojas slashed .245/.310/.336 as 19-year-old. He has gorgeous hitting hands, great rhythm and timing, and advanced feel for all-fields contact. Though Rojas' granular contact data is very strong (he had a 90% in-zone rate in 2024, for instance, which is great), there are very clearly two ways to get him out: backfoot breaking balls and elevated fastballs. He is very likely to require eventual adjustment to deal with at least one of them. He's still a very exciting offensive prospect, especially for a shortstop, there is just less certainty in this aspect of his prospectdom. 
Rojas has the athleticism, range, and actions to project as a viable shortstop, but he needs polish, as you might expect of a teenage shortstop playing a level above what is typical. Rojas' internal clock is a little slow and he struggles with short hops right now, but the foundation to stay at short is there. He still has an everyday shortstop projection, it's just a riskier version of it than was previously considered here. His medium frame means he's unlikely to develop huge power — this guy doesn't have Elly De La Cruz's ceiling or anything like that — but he has the talent of an average regular via a blend of contact, power and average shortstop defense. Rojas was initially graded as a 45+ FV on the Cubs list, but as the entire player population was considered, it felt more appropriate that end slot in this area on the Top 100."

He slashed .386/.481/.665 there and looks like a good Day Three pick, as Foster has slugged his way onto the prospect radar. He spent the end of 2023 and the first half of 2024 hitting some epic backfield blasts before thriving at Inland Empire for the last few weeks of the season. Foster has above-average raw power right now and might have another full grade in him at peak. Issues with plate coverage might become more of a problem for Rio as he climbs the minors, so he's graded as a high-variance, power-hitting sleeper at the bottom of the system for now."

Southern Playaz,Charlie,Condon,,COL,,42.0,,45+,High,22.0,30.0,30.0,60.0,40.0,"Condon set an SEC freshman record for homers as a redshirt frosh and slugged .800 in his first season of reps for the Bulldogs. He came into the 2024 season ranked 24th on the FanGraphs draft board due to concerns about his hit tool, then slashed .433/.556/1.009 (seriously) and hit 37 homers in 60 games, albeit during an historic season for offense in college baseball. Condon went third overall, signed for $9.25 million, and then had a no good very bad pro debut at Spokane during which he hit .180 and struck out 31.2% of the time. During instructs, Condon played defense but didn't get at-bats, as if he was being given time away from the plate to reset. Perhaps because I was already relatively skeptical of Condon's contact ability before the draft, I am reading his post-draft performance as signal, rather than a small sample aberration or the result of exhaustion. 
Condon's swing is relatively grooved and stiff. He swings really hard and has an incredible ability to turn on pitches on the inner third, especially for a 6-foot-6 guy, but Condon doesn't have great feel for manipulating the barrel. His swing generates enormous power on pitches down and in, but it lacks precision and variability in other parts of the zone, and he has hit tool risk despite his college performance. He was late on basically everything after the draft and wholly unable to pull the ball, which wasn't the case when he was at Georgia, where Condon had a 90% contact rate against fastballs. 
How much room Condon's contact issues will have to breathe is going to depend on where he ends up playing defense. He played third base, first base, and all three outfield spots during his time in Athens and third base, and left field after the draft. Condon bends well for a player his size, but his range at the hot corner is well below average. He is a better thrower from the outfield than he is from third base, and I thought he looked surprisingly skillful in center field at Georgia, though he's a 40-grade runner and likely not a long-term fit there. Here Condon is projected as a flawed but powerful multi-positional role player rather than an impact third baseman."

He's capable of playing all three outfield spots (he's plus in the corners), he doesn't give away at-bats, he hits the ball hard (though often on the ground), and he plays with great effort and motor. Because none of his tools are plus, Franklin is a classic tweener outfielder. He hits with his feet very close together, and his swing is handsy, geared for low-ball contact, and produces an extreme opposite field fly ball tendency. Though Franklin's hands are authoritative and his hard-hit rate (41%) is above-average, he probably won't hit for much power with this swing, which makes him an OBP-driven fifth outfield type who is fine to roster and give 125-150 PA to against lefties and sinkerballers."

Hurley slashed .245/.305/.404 at Hillsboro and K'd at a 26.9% clip. His underlying contact rates are a red flag, especially his sub-80s% in-zone rate. Hurley cuts right through a ton of pitches in the middle of the zone and lacks barrel feel, but he can swing pretty hard and gets to most of his roughly average power. More importantly, after the trade of Andrew Pintar, Hurley was able to play center field more regularly and looked pretty good. Hurley sometimes goes out of his way to show off his arm and can risk overthrowing the cutoff man or base, but you would too if you could uncork it like he can. Barring a huge rebound to Hurley's contact ability, his ceiling is limited to that of a reserve outfielder."

There was a stretch where he looked like a future first rounder, but Moore had a downtick in performance as a junior and there was a rumor at the time that he might go back to school to try to recoup some draft helium with an age-21 senior season. Instead, Moore signed with the Brewers for $800,000 as a second rounder. After two seasons in Milwaukee's system, Moore was traded to the Phillies for Oliver Dunn. In 2024, he posted a .240/.323/.364 line at Reading, a fairly accurate representation of his talent as a hitter. The tiny Moore struggles to hit for power and has some plate coverage issues from the left side, often failing to contact pitches on the outer third. Plus actions and advanced defensive acumen are now his carrying tools, enabling him to project as a viable defender at both middle infield positions and a low-impact utilityman overall."

He hit his way from the Goodyear complex to Low-A in 2024 and, combined, slashed .326/.411/.474. He's a fantastic athlete who has rare ball-striking power for an athlete of his size and age, capable of turning on low pitches with power and taking what is given in other parts of the zone. For Francisca to have such advanced barrel feel as such a young switch-hitter is very exciting. 
Limited arm strength and range will likely limit Welbyn to second base over the long haul. He plays defense with a ton of effort, but he too often makes routine plays look spectacular out of necessity. Francisca's swing is explosive enough that, despite being a tad undersized, I think he'll eventually have enough power to profile as a first-division second baseman."

Below-average rates of contact will probably always be part of his game, and ultimately will be what funnels Muncy into a utility infield role. Breaking ball chase is the main culprit here, though importantly, Muncy has enough power to keep his overall offense afloat. An important 2024 development: Muncy finally got experience at the second base. He appears more comfortable and well-suited for the keystone than third base. He turns the double play well on both ends, and projects to be an average defender at shortstop and an above-average defender at second base. Muncy’s ability to be a sound defender up-the-middle is the carrying trait of his profile. His isn't devoid of offensive ability, but it will be important for him to learn to control the zone better over time. Muncy has a good chance to debut toward the end of 2025."

But oh boy, can he play defense. Corniel was quickly promoted to Triple-A when injuries wreaked havoc on Arizona's big league shortstop situation in 2024, because if the injuries had cut any deeper, he'd have easily been the most capable shortstop defender in the entire org. He has premium range and athleticism, plus hands, and a plus-plus arm. Corniel can make all the plays at short and he has experience at second and third base, though he played less at those spots in 2024.

His combination of power, speed, and defense made him the second pick in the 2023. The leap from the Big Ten to pro pitching has so far been too much for Lasko, who is having a very difficult time making contact in pro ball. We still see above-average bat speed and power in the way Lasko swings, but he only hit six home runs in 569 plate appearances between Stockton and Lansing in 2024, while slashing .232/.353/.328 on the season. His bat path is conducive to handling pitches down in the zone but is vulnerable in other areas, and he posted a 67% contact rate in 2024. 
Lasko’s defensive chops in center field establish a higher floor for him than for most players who produce as little offense as he has. He goes after balls with controlled aggression, his plus foot speed allows him to cover up occasionally inefficient routes, and he's confident and athletic at the catch point, including around the wall. Lasko’s offensive profile doesn't provide much reason for optimism, but his defensive ability could give him solid value as a defense-first bench type."

Selected by the Red Sox, he was traded to the Pale Hose as part of the Garrett Crochet swap. Montgomery comes from a family with multiple Division-I athletes and was among the most prominent of the 2021 high schoolers to go to college rather than sign. He spent two seasons at Stanford, where he played both ways and showed meaningful bat-to-ball improvement as a sophomore after a strikeout-prone freshman year. He transferred to Texas A&M for his draft year and was the most talented player on the College World Series runner-up squad. Montgomery slashed .317/.428/.646 throughout his entire college career, with a 20% K% as a junior. 
A super physical 6-foot-2 switch-hitter, Montgomery has monster bat speed from the left side. He has a crouched leg kick, his hands load at a conservative depth, and his hips absolutely explode though contact and help ignite his awesome hack, which has big finish in the dirt behind him. Montgomery’s lefty swing generates power to all fields, and he has some ability to alter his upper body’s posture during his swing in order to clear out the top of the zone, something that he only seemed to develop during his time at A&M. His righty swing is more generic; he has a low-ball tendency from that side and his cut isn’t especially dynamic. He’s vulnerable to changeups as a lefty, and up-and-away fastballs and back-foot breakers as a righty.
Montgomery has a huge arm in right field. He was up to 97 mph as a freshman reliever — his stuff was down during his sophomore year at Stanford and he didn't really pitch at A&M — and, at least before his ankle injury, he had the speed to give center field a try in pro ball. Some of the changes he made at A&M improved the strikeout issues that were once caused by his lever length. This is a switch-hitter who was also a two-way player until 2023, and his performance is even more exciting given that context. Above-average plate discipline and a swing geared to get to his power will help Montgomery overcome what are likely to be elevated strikeout totals. He has the ceiling of a power-hitting right field cleanup batter, but he'll probably be a relatively slow developmental burn for a college player. If the impact of his swing tweaks and speed (and what that does for his potential defensive fit) appear intact upon return, he'll move into the Top 100."

But Ortiz's infield defense took a leap in 2024, and he not only looks like a lock to stay at short, he might become an impact glove there. Ortiz's exchange can still be a little slow, but his range is great and his arm strength passes left-side muster. While that's true, Ortiz hasn't really gotten any stronger and it still takes so much effort for his little body to swing hard that he ends up struggling to control the bat. He posted a paltry 64% contact rate in 2024, which is scraping the bottom of the viability barrel. He has only been switch-hitting for a couple of years, and while Ortiz doesn't have ideal body projection because he's such a rail, he should get at least somewhat bigger as he matures, and take a step forward as a hitter via both improved skill and strength. At minimum, he looks like a plus shortstop defender with 70 speed — even with a flawed hit tool, that's a good utility player. His upside will be driven by how much Ortiz develops on offense, so much of which is still TBD as he grows and changes as an athlete."

South Carolina Ballcocks,Nick,Kurtz,,ATH,38.0,34.0,,50,Med,22.0,55.0,60.0,60.0,30.0,"A gigantic individual with enormous strength, Kurtz's performance plateaued during his junior year at Wake, but he still clubbed more than 20 homers for the second consecutive season and posted a 1.294 OPS. The A's made him the fourth overall pick and The Colonel reached Double-A by the end of the summer and then picked up Arizona Fall League reps. This is an upward re-evaluation of Kurtz compared to his pre-draft grade, which had him more in the middle of the first round. 
Kurtz does some special stuff and has some unique physical characteristics that make him effective. He has plus power generated by big time thunder in his hands, and his swing features a back-side collapse, which creates power-producing loft. Despite his size, Kurtz is a short-levered guy. His front arm basically bars as he loads his hands, but his T-Rex levers help keep his swing from getting too long. He has terrific vertical plate coverage and is a threat to do damage all over the zone. Big league pitchers are likely to attack Kurtz on the outer third with fastballs and changeups, which his short levers/open stride combo sometimes cause him to swing inside. Concerns about covering the outer third of the zone were a big part of why Eric was lower on Kurtz before the draft, but while he does his fair share of whiffing in that location, he's also incredibly dangerous to the opposite field when pitchers don't quite execute there. His college (87% z-contact%, 80% overall contact) and post-draft data (86% in-zone, 76% contact, 8% SwStr%) reinforce confidence in his contact ability. 
Kurtz isn't a great athlete or bender, and he plays defense with a high center of gravity but scouts love his first base defense. He might have a relatively short shelf life as an athlete because he's such a big guy, but now isn't the time to fret about that. In the immediate future, Kurtz is likely to race to the big leagues and produce like an impact heart-of-the-order hitter at 1B."

He chased at a 44% rate in 2024 and at a whopping 59% with two strikes. Vargas is also a small-framed player and lacks physical projection (and the arm strength to project at shortstop) despite his age; the long-term ceiling on his power is capped at average or below. Vargas' hitting hands are quick and authoritative for a guy his size and his top hand drives his swing, which allows him to get on top of high fastballs and make a ton of airborne, pull-side contact. He's a bizarre prospect on paper, one of extremes both good (the quality of Vargas' contact despite middling raw power) and bad (he swings at everything and probably can't play shortstop). The lack of shortstop viability here is big. Vargas' lack of size and prototypical arm strength might confine him to second base, which makes it tough to projeect him as a flawed but fun utilityman. It puts his profile on fairly thin ice, and his impatience as a hitter means Vargas is standing on that ice wearing shoes made of lava."

Though he's played all over the place (2B/3B/SS/LF/RF), his hands make him a bit more mistake-prone than is ideal for a true utility infielder. However, Navigato is a fairly well-rounded hitter. He lacks a plus offensive tool, but his top hand is strong through contact, allowing him to get to the modest (but relevant) power he has. He's capable of generating extra-base pop to all fields, and his swing has gotten simpler and more compact as he has gotten stronger into his mid-20s. In 2024, he posted a 124 wRC+ at Toledo and slugged 21 homers, but he wasn't put on the 40-man nor was he selected in the Rule 5 Draft. He strikes us as an above-replacement player who'll likely hop on and off the bottom of teams' 40-man rosters during his prime, which is now."

FA,Jansel,Luis,,ARI,,,,45+,High,20.1,40.0,50.0,55.0,50.0,"Luis is a hard-swinging teenage infielder with a chance to grow into plus power. His hands are incredibly fast and authoritative from both sides of the plate, and he's a threat to do extra-base damage on basically any pitch he makes contact with. He won't turn 20 until March, and his well-composed frame has room for another 15 or 20 pounds of muscle without compromising his agility. Luis can also move the barrel around the zone fairly well for such a young switch-hitter, but he doesn't track the baseball. He chases and swings through hittable pitches that he just seems to lose sight of mid-hack. These issues create bust risk associated with Luis' hit tool, especially if he gets too big to play shortstop, or if his skills there stagnate. 
Luis has a similarly exciting-but-raw look on defense. He's a good athlete with great range and a well-calibrated internal clock, but he also has below-average hands, which not only prevent him from completing some spectacular plays but from making some more routine ones as well. His throwing stroke is also a little bit odd, but Luis can pretty effortlessly zip the baseball over to first base from anywhere on the left side of the infield, and this might only get easier for him as he matures. Luis remains more of a developmental prospect than one of imminent big league relevance, but he has a big ceiling as a switch-hitting middle infielder with power and is a potential everyday player, even if he continues to have issues with chase."

He has also backpedaled on defense, where his lackluster range turns ordinary plays into difficult ones. Arias has a big arm, which covers up for some of these issues, and in prior seasons he looked like a lock to stay at short. He has some bounce back potential in this area. There is also still enormous lefty bat speed here. Arias desperately needs to show bat-to-ball improvement in 2025, but he can have a below-average hit tool at maturity and still be a good player if he has the kind of power I think he will.

FA,Edgleen,Perez,,NYY,,,,45,High,18.8,50.0,50.0,45.0,40.0,"Perez holds serve in this FV tier after another outstanding year, this time on the Florida complex roster. Perez is a medium-framed, relatively mature, twitchy catching athlete with a quickdraw release and advanced bat-to-ball skills. He has the hands and lateral quickness to develop into a good receiver and ball-blocker over time, and he has impact arm strength. He looked fine catching rehabbers on the complex, who tended to have much better stuff than most rookie ball pitchers. 
Perez also looks a good bit bigger and stronger than his official height and weight (5-foot-10, 155 pounds) suggests. He doesn't have prototypical impact catcher size like an Adley Rutschman or Salvador Perez, but Edgleen isn't small. And some of Perez's underlying data is incredible. He chased just 8% of the time and 13% of the time with two strikes in 2024. Those rates will definitely increase as he climbs the minors and faces better pitching, but they're elite for his age. Perez also has a rare combination of hard-hit (45%) and contact rates (83%), with the former generated more by consistency and physical maturity than actual high-end power. Still, Perez's combo of contact ability and on-base skill should allow him to get to the power he has, even if that's only average. Whereas it's often fine for big league catchers to have one competent offensive attribute, Perez could have two or three. 
Teenage catchers are notoriously risky, which impacts Perez's grade, and he's a skills-over-projection type of prospect who lacks enormous physical upside. The Yankees have tended to bring their catching prospects along very slowly, with the likes of Agustin Ramirez, Jesus Rodriguez, and others spending multiple years at a low-level affiliate. But Perez they've pushed, and it's plausible that by the middle or end of 2025, he'll have been promoted to High-A and proven that his plate discipline and contact ability can hold up against better arms. If that's the case, then he's a pretty good bet to be on next offseason's Top 100 list."

He ended up slashing .316/.438/.601 in two seasons for the Cowboys, then .221/.349/.397 with 11 home runs and 27 steals at High-A Hudson Valley in his first full season. Lefty-hitting infielders with this kind of bat speed are uncommon, and Riggio is no slouch as a defender, either, even though he is likely limited to second base. A lack of plate coverage and barrel control is a byproduct of the effort with which Riggio swings.

Wrigleyville Fielders,Kevin,McGonigle,,DET,,23.0,,50,Low,20.6,55.0,60.0,45.0,55.0,"Ranked 19th on the 2023 Draft Board, McGonigle was arguably the high school player from that class with the highest floor because of his middle infield fit and contact ability. McGonigle's stocky build capped his power projection and, theoretically, his ceiling, but his early-career contact performance has been special enough that he might become an impact player, even with modest raw pop. 
McGonigle missed the beginning of the 2024 season due to a hamstring injury and the end of it due to a broken hamate. In between (60 games at Low-A Lakeland and 14 at High-A West Michigan), he slashed a fantastic .309/.401/.452 with more walks than strikeouts and 22 stolen in 24 attempts. His more granular data, albeit in a relatively small sample, was sensational, as McGonigle posted an 88% contact rate and 41% hard-hit rate. There aren't any big league hitters with marks that high in both categories, which, though impressive, is also an indication it's probably not sustainable. Regardless, McGonigle's short levers and terrific barrel feel, especially at the top of the strike zone, is real. He's incredibly hard to beat, even when he expands the zone (which he does much more often with two strikes). McGonigle's hard-hit rate comes more from contact consistency than big raw power. He has below-average raw and, at a maxed-out 5-foot-10, is unlikely to grow into a ton more. But his early count selectivity, and his ability to impact the ball with lift at the top of the zone, should still allow him to get to an okay amount of power for a shortstop. 
McGonigle's hands weren't as crisp in 2024 as usual, but he still has enough arm for short, a well-calibrated internal clock, and great actions around the bag. He's a low-variance everyday middle infielder tracking for a late-2027 debut."

He mostly played shortstop at Mississippi State (where he hit a career .329/.447/.447) and he's played mostly second base so far in pro ball, but his excellent speed (and flub-prone hands) make him a candidate to explore center field. Indeed, Mershon got reps in center field after he signed and again in the 2024 Arizona Fall League, where his time was cut short by what looked like a hammy tweak suffered on a dive for a shallow fly ball. Ji Hwan Bae and Garrett Hampson are examples of the sort of role Mershon could grow into as a defender. On offense, he has some pull power as a right-handed hitter and is more of a gap-pepperer from the left side. He has a shot to play a multi-positional bench role and impact the game as a runner."

He reached Double-A in 2023 but has really struggled to get going on offense since arriving, with a .221/.272/.317 line there in 110 games. D’Orazio still has prospect value because he's a very athletic, well-built player with an incredible arm. He's so fast out of his crouch and his arm action is so short and crisp that he sometimes pops sub-1.8. His accuracy is mixed and a lot of his throws are way above the bag, which is the only thing stopping his arm from being an elite attribute. Though he still has some ball-blocking issues that need to improve, the non-throwing aspects of D'Orazio's defense have taken a step forward and put him on pace to be average back there. A very upright swinger with opposite field tendencies, D’Orazio's offense perhaps has some long-term ceiling because he's such a well-built, athletic guy, but he has yet to perform against upper level pitching and it's going to be very hard for him to be on time against fastballs with his current swing. Were he an ace defender or hitting more, he'd have more of a backup catcher's profile, but as things are currently constituted, he's a third catcher on the 40-man."

Peña has real feel to hit and power despite a relatively squat frame at a stocky 5-foot-11 or so. He has thunderous hands, authoritative to all fields. Peña's swing has big time natural uppercut — at times it has an abbreviated finish, at times it finishes in the dirt behind him a la Ken Griffey Jr. — and it's going to allow him to get to big time in-game power. He has a great chance to have an impact hit/power combination. Peña's a below-average runner and athlete who plays defense with a high center of gravity; he's more of a possible third base fit with first base possibility. A mature build and feel to hit create the possibility that Peña moves quickly through pro ball. He has the talent to be a middle-of-the-order force."

This is similar (but meaningfully different) than Rintaro Sasaki skipping the NPB Draft to go to Stanford and eventually be subject to the MLB Draft, though it sounds like Morii considered an NCAA path. Morii's agreement with the A's was first reported by a Yahoo! Japan writer. Morii is a viable prospect on both sides of the ball. He has pretty electric hands in the batter's box and has been up to 95 mph on the mound. He lacks great lateral range and might be a better fit at second or third than shortstop. Though Morii is older than the rest of the class, he's likely a slower developmental burn as the A's figure out which side of the ball he fits best on. He signed for $1.5 million in January 2025."

FA,Eduardo,Tait,,PHI,92.0,93.0,,45,High,18.6,40.0,40.0,55.0,30.0,"Tait (pronounced with two syllables, Tah-eet) was part of Panama's U18 World Cup team in the fall of 2022, only about six weeks after he turned 16. He signed with the Phillies the following January and was the youngest player in the organization throughout the 2023 season, during which he hit an amazing .333/.400/.517 in the DSL. Tait followed that up with a .302/.356/.486 line in 2024, split between the complex and Clearwater, and turned 18 near the end of the season. 
Tait swings with bad intentions, selling out for pull power with enormous effort. He already has average big league raw power, which is very exciting for a hitter his age, even more so when you consider he's a lefty-hitting catcher. He's performed well in spite of a semi-concerning lack of plate discipline. In addition to his indulgent, expansive approach, Tait can struggle to get on top of fastballs up and away from him. He's likely to have a flawed offensive skill set exposed as he climbs the minors, but so long as Tait keeps getting to power and developing behind the dish, that's going to be okay. His leap from his first pro season to his second was encouraging in this regard. Tait is still not a good defender, but he's much better than the year before. He has good raw arm strength but takes too long to exit his crouch, and his ball-blocking needs to take better advantage of his size instead of relying on his hands all the time. It's not a bad spot for a teenage catcher to be. Tait's talent and FV grade are on par with a mid-to-late first round high school draft prospect. Like all teenage catchers, he's risky and likely to take a while to develop."

FA,Jesus,Made,,MIL,,17.0,,50,Med,17.9,55.0,60.0,60.0,45.0,"Made was on the 2024 International Players section of The Board because the heuristics with which I approach that market gravitate toward switch-hitting up-the-middle guys with contact feel, even when they're relatively small dudes. Made has become quite strong very quickly and has already shattered my expectations. He torched the 2024 DSL with one of the league's more cartoonish all-time statlines — .331/.458/.554 with 21 extra-base hits in 51 games. His underlying TrackMan data was even more absurd — 90% in-zone contact, 89% overall contact, 15% chase, 108 mph max exit velo, 104 mph EV90, 47% hard-hit rate — especially when you consider Made's age. Some of these marks are comfortably two standard deviations above the big league average. They are, of course, tough to contextualize given the nature of DSL pitching, but for the most part, Made's visual scouting report backs up the notion that he's a very talented young hitter. He has filled out and looks much stronger in his lower body now than he did when he was an amateur prospect, and he's on a path where his physicality could be in the Robinson Canó or Ketel Marte area at maturity. The fluidity in Made's hips as he swings and the authority in his hands through contact are both remarkable. He's capable of impacting the baseball with lift in most of the zone (including when he's crowded around his hands), and his swing has a gorgeous finish. 
The ease and stillness with which Made can swing hard is pretty special. He did struggle some with velocity, and guys with swings naturally geared for low-ball contact like Made's sometimes have issues that we simply don't know about when they're in the DSL because the pitching there isn't good enough to illuminate them. But if Made were a domestic high school prospect, we'd absolutely be talking about him as the potential top overall pick in this year's draft. He's a potential do-everything middle infielder (he's played 2B/SS/3B so far) with a special hit/power combination. The Brewers have been pretty aggressive about promoting their top DSL guys directly to full-season ball the following season, so Made is arguably priority no. 1 for me on the backfields during spring training, since he's unlikely to stick around for extended."

Even more of a red flag, Naylor also carried a 35% in-zone swing-and-miss rate on the year, which speaks to his inability to manipulate the barrel to cover multiple quadrants. Naylor’s bat speed still warrants above-average marks, but a stiff lower half hinders his ability to rotate explosively and forces him to use only his hands to move the barrel around. On the defensive side, Naylor has been playing shortstop. His hands are soft, but again, stiffness in Naylor's lower body hinders his mobility and range; ideally, he'll improve in this area while he's still feasibly young enough to do so."

He lacks a plus tool, but he's a well-rounded hitter and a viable up-the-middle defender. It’s particularly difficult to sneak one by Quero when he's hitting righty, as his swing is short and flat, which helps him make plus rates of contact from that side of the plate. He has more power as a lefty and is adept at dropping the bat head to make low-ball contact. 
Quero's defense is less mature, and his unexceptional athleticism is evident in this part of his game, which is currently below-average (but not awful) across the board. He has below-average pure arm strength, but has posted a 25% CS% rate (basically average) the last couple of seasons thanks to his accuracy. Keep in mind that while Quero has been around for a bit and has been a fringy defender for much of that time, he's been pushed through the minors aggressively and has been catching upper-level arms at age 20 and 21 the last couple of seasons. 
The presence of Kyle Teel and Korey Lee in the org clouds Quero's future somewhat because he is the worst defender of that group and therefore the one most likely to move off the position. It's possible Lee won't hit enough for this to matter, and that a year or two from now Quero and Teel will be one of the more potent young catching tandems in the league. The White Sox still have at least a year for this stuff to sort itself out before they have to make any kind of actual roster decisions related to this potential logjam. Quero is on track to be added to the 40-man this offseason, while Teel's chalk 40-man timeline is for post-2026, though his promotion pace has tracked ahead of that. Though he probably won't be a star, Quero is a well-rounded young hitter who should hit enough to be in the lineup every day, even if half the time he's a first baseman or DH."

But the good news is that it might not matter where he ends up playing defense, because Genao is starting to get stronger and deliver brutal blows to the baseball, which should enable him to profile at second or third base if it comes to that. He slashed a BABIP-aided .330/.379/.499 split between the two A-ball levels last season. Genao, who turns 21 in mid-May, has one of the cooler looking swings in prospectdom, a somewhat elaborate, full-body hack with a big finish behind him. He's more skilled as a lefty, but he can damage mistakes from either side. Aspects of Genao's swing might leave him vulnerable around his hands once he starts facing good velocity, but for now Genao (pronounced jen-OW) looks like an everyday middle infield performer in every statistical category.

Detractors were scared of how cacophonous his swing was and thought he'd need an overhaul to hit at all in pro ball, while model-driven teams rounded down on Montgomery because he was nearly 19 on draft day. The Rockies picked Montgomery eighth overall, then he had a big first full season (.313/.394/.502 at Low-A) but struck out at an alarming rate. That carried into 2023, when Benny's output dipped closer to league average. He barely played in 2024, dislocating his left shoulder and damaging the capsule and labrum during an outfield dive. He had season-ending surgery after just 11 games at Hartford. 
Montgomery went to Puerto Rico for winter ball after the season, and though he had clearly spent a lot of his rehab in the weight room, his swing is still noisy and odd. Montgomery's added mass hasn't cost him much speed, but he's still a tentative and clumsy defender in center field. Missing 2024 reps because of his injury really stings. Rust accumulates with months off, and Montgomery is returning from a severe injury he suffered while playing defense; it's fair to give him time to get comfortable out there. Still, even if he does, I fear it will be rendered moot by the lack of functionality in Benny's swing. He's a 64% contact rate guy combined in 2023 and 2024 (Cactus League, Clemente League, scraps from Hartford), which is a pretty scary number. Because he's so young and physically impressive, and plays hard, Montgomery is still a prospect, but it doesn't appear he's going to actualize his tools into real production without a swing overhaul."

He didn't play after the draft and is probably the most important extended spring scouting target in the org. 
Montgomery has a big league frame at a strapping 6-foot-4, and he has a very authoritative top hand through contact, which creates exciting pull power. We have next to no showcase performance data for Montgomery from which to derive any kind of accurate assessment of his hit tool; this guy is going from hitting varsity pitching to facing pro arms, so there's a high degree of volatility here, even more than is typically associated with prep catchers. 
Counterintuitively, the most advanced aspect of Montgomery's game right now might be his receiving. It will no doubt also be tested by pro-quality stuff, but for an athlete his size to be as flexible and skilled a low-pitch framer as Montgomery seems to be is impressive. In addition to the hit tool indicators, Montgomery's throwing is his other key developmental variable. He was popping 2.1 a lot of the time in high school.

Jimenez slashed .242/.366/.376 on the Lakeland complex in 2024 but posted an impressive 42% hard-hit rate. He isn't an especially projectable athlete at a stocky 5-foot-9, and while it's amazing that he had a hard-hit rate that sizeable given his physique, it's tough to project big long-term power for such a small guy. Jimenez also has developing to do on defense; he's not a great ball-blocker right now and lacks the size of a prototypical catcher. He could conceivably be a Garrett Stubbs type of backup."

He barely played affiliated ball after the draft. Thomas has an ideal baseball frame at a super projectable 6-foot-2; he has above-average power to both gaps and is going to grow into more. His dynamic low-ball swing plays best when Thomas' bat path is vertical; it tends to be too long when he has to flatten it out to catch fastballs away from him. His power can be neutered in the down-and-away part of the strike zone. Barring the shortening up of Thomas' swing, what were average college contact rates will likely translate to below-average rates in pro ball, but he might grow into enough power for that to be alright. At Texas, Thomas played center field, left field, and first base. His reads in the outfield aren't very good and unless they improve, his arm forces him to left. Thomas only has the two years of college experience, so it's worth a shot to continue things in center for at least a little while, and the Rockies played him in left and center during his brief pro debut. Thomas' realistic ceiling is as a power-over-hit 1B/LF platoon bat, and he requires a little more projection than is typical of a college hitter."

This is a big, physical, loose-in-the-hips outfielder with enormous raw power projection and an early-career track record of plus plate discipline and closer-to-average contact rates. There are some funky elements to De Paula's swing that have prevented him from tapping into his power in games, and that create some hit tool risk that hasn't yet been exposed. De Paula tends to lose his base as he swings, his mechanics can get handsy (sometimes he still crushes the ball anyway), and he'll spin out even when he isn't swinging all that hard. De Paula is also very vulnerable to righty fastballs running up and away from him. He swings underneath a ton of them, which will become more detrimental to his production as he climbs the minors and faces better heaters. This is a prospect who is still more about projection than present ability on both sides of the ball. De Paula is a tentative corner defender with a great arm that he has not yet tamed. He's talented enough to be valued as a 50 FV prospect because the power-hitting ceiling here is nutty if De Paula and the Dodgers can remedy even a few of his issues."

His arm strength gives him a chance to develop into a viable shortstop defender, but his size is going to be a barrier over time. Lugo hit for power in his pro debut, but also K'd at a 23% clip, which is pretty high for a DSL hitter but completely expected based on Lugo's amateur report.

FA,Alberto,Barriga,,ARI,,,,40,High,20.4,55.0,60.0,30.0,55.0,"The diminutive Barriga stomped onto the prospect radar during a nutty 2022 Complex League playoff run, but he was limited to just 10 regular season games in 2023 because of a gruesome compound fracture to his femur, which he suffered while simply rounding first base. People in attendance at that game describe the injury as sounding like a bat breaking, and there was worry it might be career-altering. Back with a vengeance in 2024, Barriga was one of the buzzier names on the backfields during extended spring training, as he was again white hot with the bat. It looked like Barriga was going to do everything except hit for power, due to his lack of size. He was snatching pitches at the top of the strike zone, spraying doubles contact all over the place, posting plus run times and pop times to second base, and generally looked twitchier, more athletic, and more advanced than all but a few of his very talented peers. 
Then Barriga's regular season was more solid than spectacular. He slashed .276/.362/.432, which is a pretty average 102 wRC+ in the ACL, then looked overmatched during a brief A-ball trial at the end of the season. His contact metrics (76% contact rate, 86% in the zone) were good but not elite, and his chase rates are a little scary (especially with two strikes) and indicate his contact rates might fall off a bit as he climbs he minors. Because Barriga, who is listed at 5-foot-9 and might be smaller than that, is atypically tiny, we simply won't know whether his little body will be able to withstand the grind of catching across a full season until he actually does it. He only caught 40 games in 2024, so we still don't really know, but he absolutely has the skills to stay back there if his body allows. It's rare for athletes this size to be primary catchers, though, and it's more likely Barriga becomes an Austin Barnes or Garrett Stubbs type of backup."

Lefty-hitting catchers with this kind of power potential are rare.

Resembling the D-backs' outfielder draft pick prototype of recent years, Caldwell is a short player with catalytic offensive qualities who had superlative contact performance on the showcase circuit. He got just over $3 million to sign rather than go to Ole Miss, but didn't play at an affiliate after the draft. Caldwell is incredibly muscular and strong for a 5-foot-9 guy. His build is maxed out, in the Jasson Domínguez/Jett Williams area physically, where there's really nowhere to go except too big. Caldwell swings really hard, but had no discernible swing-and-miss issues in high school. He doesn't often make flush airborne contact, but he's dangerous against high fastballs and wreaks havoc with his speed when he makes lesser contact.

Levittown Panthers,Jordan,Lawlar,,ARI,11.0,13.0,,55,Med,22.7,40.0,40.0,55.0,70.0,"Lawlar has been beset by injuries basically since he was drafted. He needed surgery to repair a torn labrum in his shoulder almost immediately after he drove his pro career off the lot, then was sidelined by discomfort caused by a bone growth on one of his ribs in mid-2022, before suffering a fractured left scapula when he was hit by a pitch later that season. Lawlar had a healthy 2023 and cracked the big league roster for the first time, but he didn't hit enough to usurp Evan Longoria during the Snakes' postseason run. He then tore a ligament in his right thumb during 2024 spring training, had surgery, and dealt with recurring hamstring issues a couple of times after he returned. He played just 14 games at an affiliate and was sent to play for Licey in the Dominican Winter League until around Thanksgiving, doubling his 2024 plate appearances to just over 200 total.
Lawlar has a below-average hit tool but does everything else well. He's an acrobatic defender who finds all kinds of crazy ways to contort his body and send the baseball where it has to go, which is especially evident on his feeds to second. Lawlar is often positioned so he can make plays moving right to left, which he's most comfortable with. He struggles to make accurate throws off the backhand, so putting him in position to make as few of those as possible makes a lot of sense. Lawlar got some third base reps with Licey and did fine, putting him on the depth chart at both spots on the infield's left side.  
On offense, Lawlar hit for power when he was healthy at Double-A in 2023, but his exit velocities are shockingly low (and have been for multiple years) given his pedigree and look during BP. He doesn't have great feel for the barrel, and this may be a contact quality issue rather than an actual lack of raw power. His FV grade slid as I worked on the Top 100 as a whole, and got a 10,000 foot view of the entire player population. He's on time to pull lefties with power, and shows gap-to-gap spray against righties. He has plus bat speed, but requires a ton of effort to generate it, often so much that he stops tracking the ball. It's possible that the considerable amount of time Lawlar has missed means that his hit tool will develop late, and that he'll improve enough in this regard to produce offense like Trevor Story or Willy Adames did during their years of team control. At least initially though, his offensive output might look more like like that of Danny Espinosa and Paul DeJong. "

FA,Thayron,Liranzo,,DET,81.0,69.0,,50,High,21.7,40.0,35.0,60.0,30.0,"Liranzo is a huge-framed, power-hitting catching prospect with several very raw attributes. He was part of the Dodgers' Wilman Diaz/Rayne Doncon/Josue De Paula position player group on the complex and in Rancho Cucamonga, where Liranzo hit 24 bombs in 2023. Promoted to the High-A Midwest League in 2024, Liranzo struggled early in the season, as many hitters in that league do when they shift from training in Arizona to playing in 40 degree weather in Michigan; he hit .159 in April but slashed .262/.399/.424 the rest of the year. He was traded to Detroit as part of the Jack Flaherty deadline swap, went on a torrid run after the deal, and then continued to rake in the Arizona Fall League. 
Liranzo is what I'd call a Michael Myers Prospect: slow-moving but inevitable. He's raw enough that as he enters 2025, his 40-man platform year, he’s probably still a couple of seasons away from reaching the big leagues, and will need a few more after that to hit his ceiling. Chief among Liranzo's developmental imperatives are his ball-blocking and throwing accuracy. When he has a clean exchange, Liranzo's arm is lethal. He has uncommon athleticism for a guy his size and is capable of firing rockets from his knees or from funky arm angles, à la Patrick Bailey, with some pop times hovering around 1.80 seconds late in the 2024 season. So why has Liranzo allowed stolen bases at an 85% clip the last two years? He too often fumbles his exchange and can't even get a throw off, or has the carry on his throw impacted by having a poor grip on the baseball. His stone-handed issues are evident when he tries to pick short hops, too, though Liranzo began receiving on one knee in 2024 and is learning how to use his size as a ball-blocking barrier from this body position. The physical tools to not only be a viable catcher, but a very good one, are here, and Liranzo is built like a lot of other late-blooming catchers whose size tends to win the war of attrition they're all constantly fighting. 
We can be hopeful that Liranzo will make similar progress on offense. He already has plus power from both sides of the plate at age 21 and will probably have another grade of it at his peak. He isn't a skilled hitter — Liranzo's swing is grooved and he's looking to run into mistakes that find the very middle of the zone — but he is very dangerous from both sides of the plate if he gets one. Again, we must remember this scouting axiom: Switch-hitters tend to develop late, as they have two swings they need to get a feel for. There's evidence this has been happening for Liranzo. His contact rates improved four percentage points (both overall and in the strike zone) in 2024 compared to 2023, though at 69% and 77%, respectively, both marks would rank near the bottom of the primary catcher population. The natural launch in Liranzo's best swings combined with his ability to mis-hit contact with enough strength to produce whoopsie doubles should allow him to get to power even though he's going to strike out a ton. Projected as a flawed-but-good primary catcher overall, Liranzo should have some peak power-hitting seasons that make him an All-Star."

He's a compact athlete with a very short swing that makes him tough to beat in the strike zone, but what little power Brito has ends up being undercut by his approach, which prioritizes early-count contact. Though he doesn't have ideal shortstop arm strength, Brito's effort level and instincts allow him to make some difficult plays. He's fair at shortstop and above-average at second base. In the Yonny Hernández mold, Brito should play an up/down utility infield role."

He slashed .355/.419/.704 throughout his college career with 75 homers in three seasons, and signed for $3 million as the A's second rounder in 2024, getting 25 professional games under his belt after the draft. 
White's calling card is his power. His operation in the batter’s box is very rhythmic and uses a hand hitch trigger and toe tap timing mechanism. His hands aren't exceptionally quick on their own, but White's ability to rotate explosively through his hips, combined with the loft in his bat path, produces above-average power. Chase issues make his overall profile risky. White got better in this regard as a junior (38% chase in 2023, 32% in 2024), but then backpedaled after the draft in a 119-PA pro sample (39%). White’s pitch selection ultimately limits his hit tool's ceiling; he's going to be a low-OBP player, and he'll need to get to his raw power during game action to cover up for this shortcoming. Jake Burger and Maikel Franco are similar players, though White plays better defense than either of those guys.  
A surprisingly mobile, low-to-the-ground defender for his size, White's ability to control his body well on the run puts him in a good fielding position, which allows him to cover up for below-average hands. White will have to stay as lithe and quick as possible, which can be challenging for athletes built like he is, but he has a better shot to stay at the hot corner than you'd guess when he gets off the bus. The warts on White’s offensive profile are real, but he'll bring enough value to the table with his power and ability to stay at third that he likely ends up as a regular on a lesser club, or more of a 1B/3B part-timer for a championship-caliber team."

FA,Felix,Morrobel,,LAA,,,,35+,High,19.5,40.0,40.0,45.0,45.0,"Morrobel is a toolsy developmental shortstop prospect who signed for just shy of a million bucks in 2023. Stocky and physically mature, Morrobel's rocket arm strength is what gives him a shot to stay at short even if he continues to fill out more and slows down a bit. He's capable of sizzling the baseball to first base from deep in the hole, and his arm could compensate for what might be below-average range during the bulk of his career, but like most aspects of his game, he is often playing a bit out of control. 
On offense, Morrobel swings with impressive bat speed from both sides of the plate, but it takes him a ton of effort to generate it. He managed to keep his K rate down to an inspiringly low 12.9% in 2024 as he slashed .308/.400/.327 with as many walks as strikeouts for the Angels' complex affiliate. Visual evaluation of his breaking ball recognition suggests there is a regression coming in this area, and Morrobel might be a chase-prone hitter as he climbs. His lefty swing has a downward-cutting bat path that looks rather ineffectual, and indeed Morrobel averaged a negative launch angle in 2024 (-3.9 degrees); he'll likely require a swing change at some point if he's going to make any sort of impact contact. You can clearly see why Morrobel got the signing bonus he did, but at this stage, he's much more of a toolsy dev project than an ascendant everyday shortstop."

The diminutive outfielder has a patient approach that prioritizes opposite field contact. He just barely runs well enough to play center field, and plays it with the sort of infectious, wreckless abandon that fires up his teammates. Bateman is smaller than a typical big leaguer; Guardians outfielder Will Brennan (who got stronger in pro ball, but still isn't especially powerful or big) is a fair comp for what to hope Bateman can grow into. Especially if opposing pitchers attack him fearlessly due to his lack of power, his OBP skills will probably dip a bit as he climbs. Bateman has enough in the way of skills to have some prospect value, but he's probably a low-impact bench outfielder if he makes it."

His swing is geared for low-ball power in the extreme. DeMartini often collapses to one knee on his biggest swings, and he averaged 20 degrees of launch after the draft at Clearwater, where his K rate was half of what it was in college. Realistically, DeMartini is going to struggle to cover the outer third because of his approach and has a power-over-hit skill set. If he can play multiple defensive positions, then a role similar to the one Kody Clemens has been playing is realistic. DeMartini played third base for the Hokies and got middle infield reps on Cape Cod, then the Phillies played him at all three of those positions after the draft. Plus hands are his defining trait on defense, as DeMartini lacks typical middle infield range and his arm strength is average. He had a labrum surgery on his shoulder in 2023 and it's possible aspects of his defense will improve as he gets further away from that injury."

Pineda's power isn't monstrous; instead, it's solidly average and projects above as his statuesque 6-foot-3 frame continues to fill out. He began playing first base in 2024 and has continued to get reps there in Venezuela this winter. He should have enough playable power and defensive versatility to merit a low-end platoon role.

He comfortably has the range, actions, and arm to stay at shortstop, and is great around the bag himself and at feeding teammates. On offense, Salas' low-ball swing produces gap-to-gap contact. He might struggle with high fastballs the way Jose did once he got into the mid-minors. Salas has a projectable build; he's 6-foot-3 with broad, sloping shoulders.

Dix is a switch-hitter and features a more imposing swing from the left side, where he rotates more explosively, has better rhythm, and generates serious loft. His medium frame isn’t teeming with projection, but he is already quite strong and should add another half grade of power via physical maturity. Dix is a quick twitch athlete who has reliable hands on the dirt and the instincts to stay up the middle. He had multiple shoulder injuries in high school culminating in labrum surgery the fall before his senior year; whether he fully regains his solid arm strength long-term will be critical to whether he’s capable of handling short.

There's still a great defensive foundation here. Cruz has gorgeous infield footwork and actions, turning the baseball around in the blink of an eye. He can make strong, accurate throws from all kinds of platforms and could eventually be a special defensive player. His swing can be a little noisy and long, something that has plagued a few of Chicago's high-bonus shortstop prospects.

His lack of body and power projection made it imperative that he develop a special hit tool to be an impact player, and most prospects for whom that is true end up in college, where they can more solidly demonstrate such an ability. Instead, Nori became something of a surprise first round pick and signed for $2.5 million. After the draft, the Phillies appropriately sent him straight to the Florida State League, where he played center field and got 66 plate appearances, with a handful more during postseason dev activity. 
Nori has some exciting catalytic qualities, namely his speed. He's a flat 70 runner and makes some of the fastest little strides in pro baseball. Though his feel for center field is a little unpolished, Nori has the wheels to be an impact glove out there at maturity. His offense is probably going to be a little lighter than that of most everyday center fielders, who tend to have some power. Nori's hitting hands work in such a way that it causes him to spray lots of oppo contact. He's going to pepper the gaps and the left field line with liners, and produce extra-base hits more with his legs than his power. Perhaps Nori's contact ability will be great enough for him to outpace this projection, but until there's more tangible evidence of that, he looks more like an extra outfielder."

FA,Yassel,Soler,,ARI,,,,40,High,19.2,50.0,60.0,50.0,40.0,"Soler is a bat control wizard who hasn't met a pitch he didn't think he could hit, and a lot of the time he's right. He posted nutty 2023 TrackMan data in the DSL (92% in-zone, 5% swinging strike), and while those numbers came back to Earth in 2024 (86% and 10%, respectively) when Soler came to the U.S. for complex ball, he was still arguably the most dangerous hitter on that roster. In his 239 plate appearances on the complex in 2024, Soler posted an .824 OPS while striking out 17.2% of the time. He walked just under 7% of the time. His overall chase rate on the season came in at just under 30%, but his two-strike chase rate was a scary 49%, and he’s especially prone to expanding against spin. 
Soler attacks pitches all over the zone (and outside of it) and sprays hard contact everywhere. His swing is very handsy — there isn't a lot of athletic stuff happening with the rest of his body — and at times has a downward path, but his hands are so quick and his bat speed is so dynamic that, so far, it's working for Soler. We also thought Soler made progress as an athlete and defender in 2024. He's leaner and stronger now than he was during his pro debut and this has improved his mobility on defense, though he's still at risk of moving off of third base eventually. 
There are a lot of similarities to Miguel Andujar and Ty France in Soler's game. He's an exciting young hitter with flaws that tend to undermine the profile of below-average corner defenders like him, especially if they have to move to 1B/LF the way Andujar and France did. There are scouts who think that Soler will hit enough for none of this to matter and that he'll have the hit/power combination of an everyday corner infielder regardless of his position. We're a bit more apprehensive."

Though 'Cola and a couple other Southern League ballparks tend to inflate home runs, Mack has real juice and big league physicality. At times his cut can be a little out of control, and Mack often swings over the top of secondary stuff, but he has rare all-fields power for a catcher and, even at age 22, there is still room for muscle on his frame. Mack has also posted above-average offensive lines at every level except for his 2023 campaign at High-A. Catchers sometimes play through bumps and bruises that impact their offensive production for long periods of time, and it's plausible that was true of Mack in 2023. He's going to swing and miss a ton, both because of how much effort his swing features and because Mack is not a patient hitter, but so long as he's getting to his power, that's fine for a catcher. 
Mack still needs to develop as a ball-blocker. His crouch — an endangered species, as Mack sometimes catches from a traditional crouch rather than on one knee — can be a little high and make it tough for him to get to the ground in time to act as a wild pitch barrier. He is otherwise a good defender with a tremendous arm. Capable of popping sub-1.9, Mack hosed 34% of would-be basestealers in 2024, and as stolen base attempts in the big leagues climb, it helps to have a catcher with a 70 arm. He's entering his 40-man platform year and is on pace to get his feet wet in the big leagues late in 2026."

Despite his clear predilections, which trickle all the way down to a combative two-strike approach and combine with a clearly demonstrated hole in his coverage against velocity above the belt, the burly second baseman posted the sixth-lowest strikeout rate in the Midwest League while spending the vast majority of the year at High-A West Michigan and slashing .270/.321/.392.
For someone who faced plenty of questions about his unorthodox swing after emerging as a pop-up prospect in his junior year in Lincoln, Anderson puts a lot of balls in play with a purpose (45% hard-hit rate), and while he’s not the most projectable athlete, his top-end exit velocities are already solidly in line with the big league average. But Anderson’s deeply crouched chop of a swing produces almost no pull-side airborne contact, and practically never against velocity. A groundball rate north of 50% and an aggressive approach hunting for pitches thigh-high and below are further impediments to his power playing up in games.
Anderson is a 40 runner, and his movement at second base is similarly limited. While he doesn't have a standout arm, it’s suitable for action if Anderson returns to third base, his primary position in college, which could fuel an existence as a multi-position reserve. Still, a full season spent at Double-A Erie figures to be less forgiving to his demonstrated weakness against elevated velocity."

FA,Griffin,Burkholder,,PHI,,,,40,High,19.6,40.0,45.0,50.0,70.0,"Burkholder, who ranked 70th on the 2024 Draft Board, was signed away from a West Virginia commitment for $2.5 million in the second round. He's a long-levered speedster whose swing has tended to be on time to pull the baseball even though Burkholder is a lankier guy. Per Synergy Sports, he ran a roughly 73% contact rate on the showcase circuit, which is just south of the big league average. Burkholder's hitting hands fire a little late, but they work well; they're snappy through contact and give him surprising pop for someone his age who is as sinewy as he is. Right now, that manifests as gap-doubles power, and there might be more thump on the way via added strength and perhaps even a tweak to his mechanics. There is currently very little happening with Burkholder's lower body during his swing, and he could stand to have a more athletic cut and see what kind of power arrives. 
Burkholder easily has the speed to play center field, but his balls skills are middling. The likelihood that Burkholder and Dante Nori, who is more obviously a center field fit, traverse the minors together will probably mean they split reps out there, with Nori taking the bigger piece of chicken. Burkholder has the foundation of a part-time outfield prospect, with more offensive upside than that if his frame and swing develop in a meaningful way."

He's posted in-zone contact rates in the 88-91% range so far as a pro, but the quality of his contact is often light, and he slashed .255/.381/.344 at Low-A Visalia in 2024. Torin uses very simple, conservative footwork and lets his hand-eye coordination and bat control do the work for his offense. He hits a lot of choppers and grounders and makes a ton of soft contact, posting one of the three lowest hard-hit rates among D-backs full-season hitters the last two years. He gives you glimpses of exciting rotational ability, especially when Torin has to tuck his hands in and barrel stuff in around his naval. But in general, this is a singles hitter and a smaller guy without the overt physical projection that would indicate he'll eventually have real power. 
Torin has also plateaued as a defender. He has a quick exchange and a lovely arm stroke, but his agility, range and hands are all below average for a shortstop. He's playing a mix of both middle infield spots right now, but projects to second base for us. 
The bat-to-ball skill here is pretty special and Torin is very young. We want to leave room for improvement and we value his profile, but barring an unexpected leap in his explosiveness, Torin is likely to produce akin to Luis Urías. He needs to develop either defensive versatility or power to play a more meaningful big league role."

His hands work with natural loft; he has a traditional low-ball lefty scoop. His lever length creates some hit tool risk, but Alvarez might be able to shorten up as he gets stronger. He's fast enough at time of signing to try center field in pro ball, but realistically (and perhaps ideally) Alvarez will be too big at maturity to play there. A below-average arm limits him to left field if that's the case, but the raw power to clear the bar at that position is going to be here. Potential three- or four-hole hitter with 25-plus bombs."

Ritter produced more modestly in 2024 — .270/.370/.403 with a .353 BABIP — but that was still good for a 126 wRC+ in the Eastern League. Ritter does some acrobatic stuff at shortstop but, even at age 24, he needs technical polish. He's well-built and mobile enough to continue to develop at short, but a lot of what he does there takes a little too long, and scouts' opinions of Ritter's defense are all over the map. Ritter has good power for a middle infielder but looming issues against sliders, including ones that finish in the zone, have me stopping short of projecting him for enough offense to be a good team's utilityman. Instead, he's a bottom-of-the-40-man type whose athletic longevity and power should keep him in that area for a while."

South Carolina Ballcocks,Luke,Keaschall,,MIN,60.0,45.0,,50,High,22.6,55.0,55.0,50.0,55.0,"Keaschall had two solid underclass seasons at the University of San Francisco before he transferred to Arizona State for his draft year, during which he hit an unbelievable .353/.443/.725. He had some first round buzz (probably under slot; the rumor was Boston) and was heavy in the mix of model-driven teams because he was not yet 21 on draft day. Keaschall ended up signing for $1.5 million as a second-round pick. 
The undersized Keaschall is a premium in-the-box athlete with a flexible and powerful lower body, as well as strong wrists that turn over through contact. At Arizona State, he would often look a little out of control, chasing a ton and swinging so hard that he found himself off balance. This is one of the areas in which Keaschall has changed since joining Minnesota's system. His swing rate has dropped from 50% at ASU to 38% with the Twins, and he walked more than he struck out at High-A Cedar Rapids prior to a promotion to Double-A Wichita in late May. He slashed .303/.420/.483 with 15 homers and 21 doubles in 102 games even though he was dealing with nagging right elbow discomfort that ultimately led to a late-2024 Tommy John. Aside from his hard-hit rate, which might very well spike when he returns healthy in 2025, every one of Keaschall's statistical indicators is better than the big league average. Keaschall's swing brings consistent pull-side lift to the party, which means his power production might really pop if a healthy elbow means he can hit the baseball harder. 
Keaschall's best position is ""hitter,"" and his ultimate defensive home still isn't clear. A bad college middle infielder, Keaschall continued to look rough at second base with Cedar Rapids, then he DH'd for most of May because of his elbow, and came out the other side playing more center field and even some first base. His feel for center was predictably pretty rough, but it got a little better as the season went on. Whether Keaschall's elbow issue was part of why he looked so bad at second base, we just won't know until he returns. A number of things could happen here, from ""Keaschall's feel for center field improves"" to ""healthy Keaschall hits for enough power to be a full-time first baseman."" But I'm confident enough in his bat to value him as an everyday player of some kind as he enters his age-22 season."

He posted a 145 wRC+ at Double-A Portland in 2024, his first full pro season, and was promoted to Triple-A Worcester in mid-August. It seemed plausible that Teel might debut in Boston in 2025, in part because he has played so well and in part because incumbent catcher Connor Wong has struggled. Instead, Teel became the most well-rounded member of Chicago’s fairly crowded big league/Triple-A catching contingent when he was included in the Garrett Crochet deal.  
Teel does not have the prototypical size and bulk of an everyday catcher; he’s a leaner athlete, and there are times when his lack of strength impacts his receiving and pitch framing at the bottom of the zone. But he does virtually everything else well on defense. He’s a really great ball-blocker and has sensational hands when picking balls in the dirt. Teel’s raw arm strength is average, but he is very accurate even when awkward pitch locations force him to contort his body to throw. 
On offense, his skill set has begun to take on a power-over-hit flavor. He takes a lot of high-effort cuts, and the path of his classic, low-ball lefty swing is geared for lift. Teel has struggled to cover fastballs up and away from him enough that his contact rates have fallen a bit below the major league average at catcher, but his playable power and selectivity (which helps him hunt pitches he can drive) should be enough for him to perform like a good primary backstop."

A very twitchy, undersized infielder, Montilla swings with impressive verve from the left side of the dish but is less coordinated as a right-handed hitter. When you combine his FCL and FSL data, he was more of an average contact hitter (83% in-zone contact, 73% overall) with impressive power for a hitter his size and age (106 mph max exit, 35% hard-hit rate). There's a chance Montilla can develop something close to an average contact and power combination, but his size is perhaps a gating factor for the power aspect, as he's athletic but smaller. He can really button a fastball, especially from the left side, but he struggled with the quality of A-ball secondary stuff upon his promotion, so there's some lurking hit tool risk here, too. Realistically, Montilla has utility infield projection, but he's still among the more talented low-level position player prospects in the Tigers system."

Baro has exciting physical projection for a lefty-hitting infielder, and is a heady and athletic third base defender with uncommon range and bend for such a tall guy. Especially if he ends up with a bit more arm strength as he fills out, he projects to be a special hot corner glove. On offense, Baro shows an ability to track pitches and use the whole field. His hands are sometimes a little late to fire, but as he gets stronger, he should be able to shorten up.

Fairfax Flying Squirrels,Travis,Bazzana,,CLE,10.0,24.0,,50,Low,22.6,55.0,60.0,55.0,60.0,"A six-sport athlete at Turramurra High School (about 20 minutes north of the Sydney Opera House), Bazzana ran track (100m dash, long jump and high jump), played soccer, basketball, and rugby, lettered in cricket from grades seven (!) through 12, was captain of his high school's state championship cricket team, and was on Australia's U18 Baseball World Cup roster in 2019. He was immediately a good college hitter at Oregon State, where he slashed .360/.497/.660 throughout his career and .407/.568/.911 as a junior with 28 homers and only 37 strikeouts. The Guardians made him the first overall pick in the 2024 draft and Bazzana struck out at a surprising 25.4% clip in 122 PA at High-A, twice what he did before the draft.
A compact athlete cut from the same cloth as Rougned Odor and Brian Dozier, Bazzana has terrific plate coverage, with power and swing loft that ensures he gets to it in games. This guy can bang to all fields. Short levers enable Bazzana to turn on inside pitches with power (this is where he's most dangerous), while his raw strength and bat speed give him oppo-gap doubles pop. Bazzana has an uphill, damage-causing bat path all over the zone, and his lower body can dip to help him scoop low pitches.
Though he runs well in a straight line, Bazzana is not an especially graceful mover, nor a very good second base defender. He's a 40-grade athlete in space, with below-average hands and arm strength. Very similar to JJ Wetherholt, Bazzana lacks the size of your typical impact big leaguer, but à la Rougie, there's plenty of precedent for a guy like this succeeding. Considering his non-traditional baseball background, it's conceivable that Bazzana still has room for growth as a hitter as he gains high-level experience. Athletic limitations make it tough to forecast the same kind of growth on defense, but Bazzana has been an ""arrow up"" guy for the last three seasons, and should be a good everyday second baseman even if he isn't a great defender."

Iowa Cubs,Nelson,Rada,,LAA,,,,45,Med,19.6,50.0,45.0,30.0,60.0,"The Angels floored Rada's promotion pace in 2024, and he began the season at Double-A Rocket City at just 18 years and seven months old. After being skipped over High-A entirely, his production predictably dipped; he slugged just .269 and had just 13 extra-base hits in 123 games. It is very difficult to contextualize Rada's offensive performance, and it's possible he was pushed in a way that was detrimental to his development, because he looked overmatched basically all year. He was basically a high schooler competing against pitchers who were, on average, about six years older than he was in 2024. 
Rada is a stocky 5-foot-8; his listed height dropped two inches after MLB's independent measurement last spring. He is not the typical 6-foot-1 teenager who you could see adding 20 or so pounds of muscle over time. It's important that the contact aspect of Rada's game ends up being a plus attribute because he probably won't develop big power. His strikeout rates have been climbing with each promotion, but again, it's fair to conclude his 2024 assignment was unreasonable and the root cause of this. Rada struggled to make contact with anything that wasn't in his natural bat path, and he swung over the top of a ton of breaking stuff and underneath many fastballs up and away from him. Improvement in this area will be key to him outpacing this updated, lower-variance fourth outfielder projection. 
Rada's defense is easily the most special and advanced part of his game. His range, routes, and balls skills all project to be plus if they aren't already. His poise and comfort out there is incredible for a player his age, and Rada's future defensive grade is only capped by his speed, which is ""merely"" plus and at risk of trending down because of how his build might progress. Rada is still a good prospect, but a lack of power projection caps his ceiling somewhat. Guys like Adam Eaton and Cedric Mullins provide examples of what it looks like when an outfielder this size succeeds in a big way despite a lack of physicality. It's still possible for Rada to get there, but it looks less likely now that he's encountered some hit tool instability."

Lewisberg All Blacks,Jose,Perdomo,,ATL,,,,40+,Med,18.5,50.0,,55.0,40.0,"Perdomo got the biggest bonus in the 2024 international amateur class at a cool $5 million, the most ever by a Venezuelan player. Hamstring injuries limited him to just eight games during his would-be debut season. Of potential concern here is that my notes on amateur Perdomo featured comments on his general lower body stiffness. At the time, that was an indication that the physically mature infielder would have to move off of shortstop, but now that he's also had a severe soft tissue injury, his near-future health is of particular importance and focus. The good news is that Perdomo's swing looked pretty good during that tiny eight-game stretch; I was able to source roughly half of his 2024 in-game swings from ops personnel and, just as it was before he signed, you can see why the Braves gave him a multi-million dollar bag. 
We still don't truly know anything about Perdomo's purportedly precocious feel to hit, though. We do know the Braves seemingly intended to assign him to the FCL roster before the first hammy issue, an indication that they thought he was ready to compete a level above what is typical for a prospect his age. Perdomo still looks like a guy who will have to move off of shortstop and will end up at second or third base, but he has the power to be a relevant regular at either spot if it turns out he can actually hit. This is a slight downgrade from Perdomo's pre-signing eval because of the risk created by a) the recurring injuries and b) the lost season of reps because of them."

During that time, he was traded to the Yankees and spent 2024, his first year in the org, at Scranton. Vivas broke his orbital bone during spring training and slashed .225/.348/.358 upon his return. Small but strong, Vivas doesn't have big raw power, but he takes a pretty healthy hack for a guy his size and he's maintained above-average contact rates as he's climbed the minors. Where he hasn't progressed is on defense. Vivas is not especially good at either second or third base. He is a bottom-of-the 40-man type who can play a low-impact 2B/3B platoon role on an active roster."

FA,Alfredo,Duno,,CIN,,,,55,High,19.2,35.0,30.0,70.0,40.0,"Duno is one of the freakier prospects in baseball, a tool shed 6-foot-3-ish catcher with elite power potential and and eye-popping speed for someone so big. His titanic size and strength, as well as his remarkable athleticism for such a huge teenager, give Duno both extraplanetary power potential and room to forecast huge growth on defense. 
After a 2023 pro debut in the DSL, the Reds skipped Duno over the domestic complex and sent him straight to Low-A Daytona in 2024. There Duno slashed .267/.367/.422 with a 28.8% K% in 32 games before he broke a rib and was shut down for the rest of the year. Duno looked like he was starting to get a feel for how to use his size on defense in the couple of weeks leading up to his injury, and this was especially true when it came to ball-blocking. Duno's mobility for a catcher his size is incredible, and the way he can bend and explode out of his crouch to field his position is very exciting. His throwing has not been as good as was advertised when he first signed. He dealt with elbow issues in 2023 (which is why he didn't catch that year), and he hasn't shown a consistently plus hose stateside, though some of that is because his footwork coming out of his crouch has been so inconsistent. It's something to watch, but the way Duno progressed on defense in his little bit of healthy 2024 play was very positive overall. 
At the plate, Duno is still getting a feel for his volcanic bat speed and bodily verve, but holy cow, can this guy swing it. He has plus raw power right now at age 19 and is going to grow into more. He's big but not maxed out, built like Heliot Ramos scaled up four inches. Duno is also shockingly fast, and not just for his size, posting some run times to first base near 4.25 seconds in his limited action. Duno presents one of the most exciting toolsets in all of minor league baseball, but he hasn't played very much yet, and whether or not his strikeout issues can improve via regular reps will dictate how good he becomes. He's a risky prospect with superstar ceiling, and my tape study of his defense was encouraging enough to say that he raised his floor in 2024 even though he didn't get the opportunity to race up the minor league ladder."

FA,Juan,Flores,,LAA,,,,40,Med,19.1,35.0,40.0,30.0,20.0,"Flores is a skillful young defender whose offensive ceiling will likely be capped by his lack of size and his tendency to chase. He has some pull power but is much more likely to have a career as a glove-first backup than as a primary catcher. Flores is an unbelievably skilled thrower of the baseball. He has fairly average raw arm strength, but the quickness of his exchange and his ability to turn around poorly located pitches with pace and accuracy is remarkable. Flores' hands are also an asset when picking pitches in the dirt. He's a smaller athlete who needs to get stronger so his receiving can be quieter, but the other aspects of his defense are already very advanced and he projects as a plus defender with a plus arm. 
On offense, Flores is best when he gets something up and in that he can turn on. He is otherwise not a very dynamic or patient hitter. He's a compact athlete without a ton of physical projection and is unlikely to add much strength or power. He's ahead of the typical promotion pace for a teenager, but likely won't fight for a big league roster spot until 2028 or 2029."

He has yet to have an impressive statistical full-season performance, with a mid-80s wRC+ at Low- and Double-A each of the last two years. He's another of the Angels' prospects who almost completely skipped over their High-A affiliate in southeast Washington. Guzman is only 20, putting his .206/.297/.304 line at Double-A Rocket City (west of Huntsville, Alabama) in a more forgiving light. To the eye, he still looks like a good defensive shortstop with a shot to develop above-average raw power at peak.
Guzman's tools are like Diet Willy Adames. He has cleaned up some of the odd looking aspects of his defensive actions (which were once strange and stiff when he had to make plays in on the grass), and he's really great at backhanding balls in the hole and making strong throws back across his body. Guzman is also an impressive in-the-box rotator and swings pretty hard for a 20-year-old, but his cut is quite long and grooved. Guzman has had concerningly high strikeout rates in the minors and lacks any kind of barrel feel, and he probably won't get to all his raw power in games because of this. This is the biggest hurdle for Guzman to clear if he's going to develop into an everyday shortstop. He's more likely to be a utility infielder who runs into a dozen annual bombs."

FA,Rafael,Flores,,NYY,,,,40,High,24.4,30.0,30.0,45.0,40.0,"Flores played more games at catcher than first base in 2024, a flip of his 2023 full season debut. The strapping 6-foot-3 backstop has improved enough as a defender to be considered a viable big league catcher, albeit not a great one. Flores' best attribute on defense is his pure arm strength, which he can show off from some tough platforms. He still allowed over 100 stolen bases at an 85% success rate in 2024 because of too many botched exchanges and inaccurate throws, as if he doesn't always have a great grip on the baseball when he lets it go. Flores' pitch framing looks incredible on paper — Synergy Sports has his shadow zone strike rate way up at 70% (though the pitch locations are subjective at Double-A, so a healthy grain of of salt is in order here) — but to the eye, he's a little worse than average. 
On offense, Flores slashed a cartoonish .279/.379/.495 in a season split between High- and Double-A, which is great for a small school undrafted guy in his second full pro season, but a little tougher to contextualize given his age and mature physicality. Flores has plus raw power and he's able to create it in a fairly short mechanical distance. He crushes mistakes and is an explosive rotator, but he isn't a skillful hitter who's making contact all over the zone, as his swing is grooved middle-middle and isn't in the hitting zone for very long. His contact data — 70% contact rate overall, only 76% inside the strike zone — is comfortably below average on the big league scale, and Flores performed that way as a 23-year-old in the mid-minors. I have reservations about Flores' ability to make enough contact to access his power and think he'll be a volatile bat-first backup."
