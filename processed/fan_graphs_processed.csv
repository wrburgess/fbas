Roki Sasaki,SP,LAD,2025,1,65,High,23.2,,,,,"Sasaki cemented a legacy while he was still in high school. There was a stretch when he was asked to throw nearly 500 pitches in an eight-day span, including a 12-inning complete game during which he also hit the game-winning two-run homer. He became the LeBron James of Japanese baseball in the process and was the first pick in the 2019 NPB draft, wielding much more arm strength than the typical top-of-the-class arm there, touching 101 mph and sitting around 97. 
In 2021, Sasaki amassed a 1.98 ERA in 77 total innings across 15 starts split between the Eastern League (NPB's minor league) and the Pacific League (their top league). The 2022 season was his first full slate in Japan's big league and Sasaki was great, making 20 starts, pitching 129 innings, posting a 2.02 ERA and making international headlines by throwing 17 consecutive perfect innings in April. At one point, Sasaki retired 52 consecutive batters (the MLB record is Yusmeiro Petit's 47) during that stretch. Sasaki was having an even better 2023 — 85 IP, 39% K%, 5% BB%, 62% GB%, 1.88 ERA, 0.92 FIP — before he was shut down with an oblique tear in July, which cost him most of the rest of the season. He made three appearances at the very end of 2023 and his stuff was crisp as usual. 
In 2024, however, it backed up pretty substantially, as did Sasaki's overall performance. He hasn't been healthy for an entire season yet and most of his relevant stats (his ability to generate whiffs with his fastball, avoid walks, and get groundballs) took a nosedive in 2024. Sasaki's plus-plus, upper-80s splitter (which often has slider shape to his glove side and can easily be mistaken for it) is still easily his best pitch, and might be the nastiest splitter on the planet. When he's operating at apex, Sasaki looks like a slam dunk, top-of-the-rotation talent, like one of the best handful of pitchers in baseball. He's young and seems likely to return to peak form at some point, though his injury history and general volatility keep him from being a 70 FV player. After buzz late in 2023 and early in 2024 that he was poised to be posted after the 2024 season, Sasaki signed with the Dodgers as part of the 2025 international class and enters camp primed to slot into their big league rotation."
Roman Anthony,RF,BOS,2026,2,60,High,20.9,45,45,70,50,"In high school, Anthony presented clubs with a risky but exciting combination of present raw power and long-term power projection, but he made a below-average rate of contact on the showcase circuit (71%) and, at his size, seemed likely to end up at a corner position on defense. It's part of why he was in essence a late-first round pick (he went 79th overall, but his $2.5 million bonus was in line with the 30th overall pick) rather than an obvious top prospect. 
In pro ball, Anthony's swing has become looser, and more active and kinetic, as his hands build enormous momentum before they explode and break the sound barrier with some of the best bat speed in pro baseball. The whip and looseness of his hips and hands at his size is very special. These changes not only unlocked a new gear of raw power for Anthony, who is now a career .284/.398/.473 hitter in the minors, but they also seem to have made him more comfortable and adept at moving the barrel around the zone. He posted a 75% contact rate in 2024 as he dominated Double- and Triple-A at age 20. The adjustments have also made Anthony more adept at covering fastballs running up and away from him, which was an issue for him in high school and upon his entry into pro ball, though they've also caused him to concede some of his ability to scoop low pitches. His cut often has a downward path, which is part of why he averaged just nine degrees of launch in 2024, though that's up from six degrees in 2023. Anthony's strikeout rates have hovered in the 23-25% range the last couple of seasons (a little south of the big league average) in part because he's a very patient (bordering on passive) hitter who runs a ton of deep counts. His 39% swing rate from 2024 would have been the fourth-lowest in the majors last year. Though his swing isn't totally optimized to get to all of his raw power right now, Anthony has such ridiculous juice that he's going to hit for power anyway. LIke Jarren Duran before him, Anthony's feel for actualizing that power in big league games will probably take a little bit of time to reach its apex, but at peak, Anthony will be a middle-of-the-order monster posting huge power and on-base percentages. 
Speaking of Duran, the presence of him and Ceddanne Rafaela on the roster would likely usher Anthony to an outfield corner most of the time regardless of whether or not Roman could actually play center field, but as Anthony has filled out and become more physical, he has begun to slow down enough to shift his defensive projection to a corner anyway — probably right field because of his terrific arm. Boston has a glut of outfielders at the big league level, with Anthony charging hard behind them. He might already be a better option than Masataka Yoshida, and Rafaela's swing-happy approach makes him a volatile player. It's plausible we'll see Anthony be added to Boston's roster in the middle of the year if they're in the thick of it with the other good teams in their division. If the big league club is again toward the back of the pack, then it's more likely Anthony exhausts rookie eligibility in 2026."
Dylan Crews,CF,WSN,2025,3,60,Med,23.1,50,50,60,70,"Crews went wire-to-wire as one of the best 2023 draft prospects, if not <em>the</em> best. He was the top unsigned high schooler from the 2020 class, a toolshed who swung and missed on the summer showcase circuit more than teams felt comfortable with. He ended up at LSU rather than in pro ball, and from day one was among the toolsiest and most productive college hitters for three straight years. He slashed .380/.498/.689 and had more walks than strikeouts during his tenure at LSU. Crews' first full pro season also went well. He slashed .270/.342/.451 split between Double-A Harrisburg and Triple-A Rochester, then was called up at the end of August to get his feet wet without exhausting rookie eligibility. His underlying data was much better than his surface-level stats during that stretch. 
Crews can punish you to all fields. He'll get extended on fastballs away from him and crush them the opposite way, and he can also turn on slower pitches on the middle two-thirds of the plate and hit some titanic blasts to left. His best swings feature unbelievable verve and explosion, with Crews' lower body usage evoking Mike Trout. At times, the depth of Crews' load will leave him late on fastballs. Early in 2024, he was really struggling with fastballs tailing in on his hands, but by the time he was in the big leagues at the end of the year, Crews had begun to move off the plate against righties (we won't know how this impacts his plate coverage against sliders until we see more). He also cuts his stride with two strikes, but can still generate power because of how explosive the rest of his operation is. All of this is very similar to Jackson Chourio, and Crews will might need a similar adjustment period before he really takes off. 
Some of the Chourio similarities extend to Crews' defense. He can absolutely fly and will show you jailbreak-y, sub-4.1 run times. He easily has the speed to play center field, but his reads, routes, and ball skills aren't great. His pure speed should enable him to remain in center field, but he's probably going to underperform out there relative to his pure speed. The opposite is true on the bases, where Crews' speed arguably plays up because of his feel and acumen. Even if he's relegated to a corner due to the presence of superior on-roster options in center, he's going to hit for enough power and make a big enough impact on the bases to be a star."
Sebastian Walcott,SS,TEX,2027,4,60,High,19,45,40,70,45,"Walcott was seen some in the U.S. during the fall of 2021, and he leapt off the field because of his physicality and power. The Rangers international scouting group was originally connected to a player named Camilo Diaz for a rumored bonus of $3 million, but seemingly diverted to Walcott around this time (Diaz later signed with Houston). Walcott signed in January of 2023 and immediately stood apart from his peers on the backfields because of his size and bat speed. He went to the D.R. for the start of the 2023 DSL season, but was quickly promoted to Arizona and lit up the ACL up for a month (he was hondo'd at this time) before opponents realized he couldn't recognize a breaking ball. He ended up having a .273/.325/.524 line in Arizona with terrifying peripherals, including a 6.4% walk rate and 32.5% strikeout rate. In 2024, the Rangers sent Walcott, who turned 18 during spring training, straight to High-A Hickory. Amazingly, he held his own there, slashing .261/.342/.443 with 10.6% walks (sigh of relief) and 25.5% strikeouts before earning a promotion to Double-A Frisco for the final week of the season. 
As you are reading this Top 100 blurb, Walcott is still just 18 years old. He has immense physical ability, a cathedral ceiling, and the long-term athletic projection to be very good for a very long time. He looks like a future NFL wide receiver in his uniform and has elite hand speed in the batter's box, which he generates with shockingly little effort for a hitter his age. There are some mechanical flaws and nits to pick with Walcott's swing, but when you're this talented, these tend not to matter. Walcott's front side often opens up toward third base when he swings, leaving him very vulnerable to sliders away from him. His tendency to chase and miss against secondary stuff is still kind of scary, but his fastball swing decisions are very good, and overall, his baseline chase and two-strike chase were about the big league average in 2024. His bat path slopes down and tends to swat the baseball into the ground, unless Walcott is making contact way out in front of the plate, at which point those of you in the parking lot need to keep your head on a swivel. Despite his issues, Walcott is generating plus big league peak exit velos as a freaking 18-year-old, and just had a 125 wRC+ season in the mid-minors even though the paint on many aspects of his game is still wet. His stride direction might require eventual adjustment, but rather than intervene right now, I think it's fine to see if Walcott's timing and feel to hit come naturally once he's challenged. 
By the end of the season, Walcott had also leveled up on defense. He lacks the footspeed and twitch of most big league shortstops, but his ability to bend at his size is amazing, and Walcott's short arm stroke (reminiscent of Manny Machado's) allows him to effortlessly send the baseball wherever it needs to go. His actions and exchange on slow rollers have also improved. By the end of the season, Walcott (who still has some accuracy hiccups) did not seem sped up or flustered by the speed of the game on defense like he had early in the season. Walcott's ceiling as a power hitter is as big as any prospect in the minors, and of the players close to him, he pretty comfortably has the best chance at remaining at what is arguably the most valuable position in baseball. This guy is easily the odds on favorite to be the top prospect in baseball a year from now, and he's a grade of breaking ball recognition away from being a 70 FV talent."
Samuel Basallo,C,BAL,2026,5,60,High,20.6,40,55,70,40,"Basallo is a power-hitting kaiju catching prospect who looks like a gear-wearing Rafael Devers. His swing looks a lot like Devers', and he too has plus-plus power projection, a penchant for expanding the zone, plus arm strength, and some profound defensive flaws. Basallo became one of baseball's best prospects in 2023, as the then-18 year-old hit .313/.402/.551 with 53 extra-base hits in 114 games and smooched Double-A. A stress fracture in Basallo's right elbow, which was discovered just before 2024 spring training, kept him from catching until May and limited his action behind the dish for the entire season. He caught in just 56 games all year and donned the tools of ignorance on consecutive days only eight times, while splitting his remaining games nearly equally between first base and DH. He hit .289/.355/.465 as a 19-year-old at Double-A Bowie, then was called up to Norfolk for the final month of play, but didn't really hit. 
The elbow issue may have had a temporary impact on Basallo's game, especially his throwing, which was a plus-plus attribute in 2023 and more of an above-average one in 2024. Basallo was popping closer to 1.95 on average rather than being in the 1.8s like he was in 2023, and his footwork remains kind of sloppy and immature. As is true of a lot of catchers his age (let alone his size), Basallo could stand to be more accurate and consistent coming out of his crouch, but he easily has the raw arm strength to catch, and if his peak form returns, he's just some technical polish away from being a run-stopping weapon. His receiving isn't good yet, but it isn't so terrible that it damns Basallo permanently to first base. His ball blocking might be though. It's this area of Basallo's game that most needs to improve, especially when it comes to backhanding balls in the dirt. His size and mobility (especially when he's moving to his left) are commensurate with the traits of a primary catcher, but if Basallo were promoted tomorrow, he'd probably be a ball-blocking liability. 
Though his offensive numbers have been incredible (he's a career .286/.364/.477 hitter and has always been young for his level), Basallo has some growing to do at the plate as well. He's very chase-prone, including much more often against fastballs than is typical, but Basallo already has ridiculous left-handed power at age 20 and is going to grow into more. Ludicrously listed at 180 pounds, he's actually more like 250 and is built like a sophomore edge rusher. He's an unbelievably explosive rotator for an athlete his size, and Basallo's peak exit velocities are already one or two standard deviations better than the big league average, depending on the metric. The players who make a huge big league impact despite a ton of chase and a contact rate hovering around 70% (like Basallo's) all have this kind of power, hitters like Salvador Perez, Teoscar Hernández, and Bryce Harper. Basallo's power is absolutely going to be at the level of those guys and other sub-70% contact sluggers, and if he can refine his approach as he matures, he's going to become one of the best hitting catchers in baseball in his prime.
Basallo's chalk 40-man platform year is 2025. He's been promoted ahead of that pace so far, but it's pretty rare for catchers with his particular issues to be in the express lane to the big leagues. If the Orioles just want access to Basallo's bat and decide to fast track him as a DH, or proactively move him to first base knowing Adley Rutschman is in place as the franchise catcher for a while, then a late-2025 debut feels possible. If the Orioles want to give Basallo the best chance of having immediate success as a big league catcher, then he's more likely on a late-2026 or spring 2027 trajectory. There are few other prospects in the minors who have this kind of offensive ceiling and a chance to play a premium position."
Andrew Painter,SP,PHI,2025,6,60,High,22,,,,,"Painter ended 2022 as one of the best two or three pitching prospects in baseball. He overpowered hitters with his fastball at the lower levels of the minors, but by the end of the year, he was carving up Double-A and looked like a fully-formed, four-pitch monster. He entered the spring of 2023 with a legitimate shot to break camp in the Phillies rotation, like a pitching version of Fernando Tatis Jr. from a few years earlier. Instead, Painter's elbow barked and he was shut down with a partial UCL tear after his first Grapefruit League outing. Painter and the Phillies, who rightly believed they’d be contenders, opted for a plasma-rich platelet injection rather than immediate surgery, in the hopes that the right-hander would be able to pitch at the end of the season and possibly into October. But Painter's elbow didn't heal completely from the PRP and rest, and he needed Tommy John toward the end of July. The timing of the surgery meant his rehab lasted through the entire 2024 regular season, in essence costing Painter two whole years. He was sent to the Arizona Fall League, where he again looked excellent. In six outings, Painter pitched 15.2 innings, struck out 18, and allowed 14 baserunners, usually sitting 94-98 while touching 100 and flashing the same plus slider and curveball combo that made him lethal in 2022. 
Good luck getting on top of Painter's fastball when he locates it at the top of the zone. Even though he's so big and his pitches travel downhill toward the imaginary rectangle, it has still been hard for hitters to snatch his high fastballs, similar to the way Justin Verlander's fastball plays despite his size and release height. Both of Painter's breaking balls have huge movement but are still a bit of a work-in-progress in terms of their usage. Painter is much more comfortable locating his breaking balls in the zone rather than as chase pitches. His slider has two-plane sweep and tended to be in the 86-90 mph range in Arizona, while his curveball is more north/south and sits 82-85 mph. Perfecting his slider locations is one key to Painter maxing out; the other is finding a weapon to thwart lefties. He can pitch backwards off his curveball and finish them with high fastballs, but Painter would do well to either find more consistent curveball finish below the zone, or a better changeup, to do so. He began incorporating more changeups into his mix later in his AFL run. The pitch was 7% of Painter's usage late in 2022 after he had been promoted to Reading, and he will show you a really good one every fourth try or so. He's loose enough to project this pitch as being a fourth above-average weapon down the line. 
Phillies POBO Dave Dombrowski told reporters in December that Painter's 2025 season will start on a delay. In order to backload his innings for the middle and end of the season, he's on track to pitch in competitive games ""July-ish."" Independent of his initial innings cap, Painter is one of the best pitching prospects in baseball. He extends the shelf life of an already stacked Phillies rotation deep into the future."
Kristian Campbell,2B,BOS,2026,7,60,High,22.8,50,50,60,60,"At Georgia Tech, Campbell was an outstanding slash-and-dash leadoff man who was among the most difficult Division-I hitters to make swing and miss during the 2023 season. He hit .376/.484/.549 and struck out just 17 times in 217 PA during his draft year as an age-eligible redshirt freshman. The Red Sox have essentially made him into a Jarren Duran sequel, taking another speedy, contact-oriented second baseman and making subtle changes to his swing and approach, resulting in a seismic shift to his offensive output, which now includes big power. Campbell posted a .997 OPS in his first full pro season and raced from High- to Triple-A by the end of the year. 
Campbell is now swinging with damage-seeking intent and has been able to lift the ball more (three degrees of launch in 2023, nine degrees in 2024). The power he's generating with his new style is shocking. His high-end exit velocities are now comfortably plus on the big league scale (he hit a ball 114 mph last year), and he's doing huge damage to all fields. 
These changes have come at the expense of some of Campbell's ability to make contact (he had a 90% contact rate in college, 81% in pro ball 2023, and 78% in 2024), but not so much that he's totally out of control and at risk of not hitting. His cut still looks weird, like it did in college, when he was often chopping down at the baseball. But no matter how you slice up Campbell's performance, statistically or visually, there isn't a pitch type, location, or velocity threshold where you really encounter a red flag. This weirdo swing works for Campbell even though it's unconventional, and he's now proven it across 340 upper-level plate appearances. He crushes mistakes in the middle of the plate and squibs hard-hit contact around the diamond on pitches closer to the edges of the zone. And unlike a lot of the powerless college bat-control mavens who go on Day Two of the draft, Campbell isn't undersized or unathletic; he's a strapping 6-foot-3 guy with explosive rotational athleticism. This isn't a skills-over-tools type who fails to check the physical scouting boxes; this is a projectable athlete who has only played high-level baseball for two seasons.
The early part of the 2025 season needs to be about Campbell finding a viable defensive position. He played second base at Tech, then mixed in a lot of center field during the first half of 2024 before that experiment took a back seat to reps at shortstop during the second half. Campbell is a plus runner who has the wheels for center, but his feel for the position (especially coming in on balls in front of him) is very raw. His athleticism bailed him out of some bad reads last year; Campbell would get twisted around out there and still find a crazy way to make the play, which was pretty exciting given the context of his development. The Red Sox already have lots of good upper-level outfield options, though, so while continued experimentation in the outfield might have been more worthwhile for other orgs, his best chance at cracking Boston's lineup soon is on the infield. Campbell is at his best when he is moving from right to left while making the play. He doesn't have the pure arm strength to play shortstop, but the Red Sox were positioning him deep in the hole so that he could make most of his throws with his whole body's momentum moving toward first base. If Campbell is asked to make throws from any kind of odd platform, his strength and accuracy waiver, and this includes when he's playing second base. His arm accuracy issues might always mean he's a bit of a sketchy option on defense even though other aspects of his game (range, hands) are fine. Where Campbell plays at the big league level on any given day could be dictated by where the ball is least likely to be hit based on the matchup, and he might continue to rove. He's going to be a unique impact player, both in terms of his style and roster fit."
Dalton Rushing,C,LAD,2025,8,60,Low,24.1,50,50,55,45,"Hidden under the Henry Davis bushel at Louisville, Rushing finally got regular reps in 2022 and played himself into the draft's first day. He was a bat-first prospect whose defensive issues (ball blocking, throwing accuracy, a general lack of polish as a receiver) seem to have been due to a lack of playing time rather than a lack of talent, as Rushing has improved fairly quickly in a lot of these areas whilst raking his way to Triple-A. He's a career .273/.410/.520 hitter as a pro and is approaching the big leagues so quickly that it might force the Dodgers to roster him and Will Smith simultaneously, a possibility that has led to experimentation with Rushing at first base (2023) and in left field (2024). Rushing's plus-plus arm (he absolutely launches out of his crouch and routinely pops below 1.9 seconds) would be kind of a waste at either position. Rushing's throwing accuracy can still be a tad wayward and he remains a below-average receiver and pitch framer, but he's gotten much better at picking balls in the dirt, and he's started to backpick runners at first when he has the opportunity. There's still work to be done here, and Rushing's framing around the edge of the zone really pulls down his overall defensive ability right now, but his arm and the rate of his progress in other areas is very exciting. 
On offense, Rushing's muscular physique generates above-average raw power and his swing is tailored to get to it. In fact, he's so geared to launch that Rushing might outproduce his raw power in games. It's enough offense that it doesn't really matter what position Rushing plays; he's going to hit enough to profile. If he can keep improving as a defender, he'll be a multi-time All-Star."
Jackson Jobe,SP,DET,2025,9,60,Med,22.7,,,,,"Jobe was the consensus top high school arm in the 2021 draft and earned a bonus of nearly $7 million as the third overall pick. He had a somewhat rocky first full season in pro ball and his velocity was down a bit compared to his peak pre-draft look. Hitters seemed unphased by Jobe's trademark curveball despite its elite spin and huge depth. He struggled to throw strikes and the visual quality of his stuff regressed. Then Jobe was put on the IL to start 2023, and missed two and a half months recovering from lumbar spine inflammation. When Jobe returned in mid-June, he did so with a vengeance; he tallied 103 strikeouts and just 11 walks in 79.2 IP (including his Fall League stint), and his fastball often touched 98-99. The first half of Jobe's 2024 season was interrupted by a hamstring strain, but he returned in June and by the end of July had stretched back out to six inning per start while holding his peak stuff. He debuted in Detroit's bullpen late in the season. 
Jobe scrapped his curveball in 2023 (more on that in a second) and now utilizes a firm 87-92 mph cutter and a low-80s sweeper (averaging 3,000 rpm), while also having upped his changeup usage considerably. Neither of Jobe's new breaking balls has consistent quality of finish just yet; both are a little better than average. His changeup is his nastiest and most reliable secondary pitch right now, as Jobe uses it against both lefties and righties and leans on it when he falls behind. The changes he's made in response to the ineffectiveness of his 2022 breaking ball made Jobe a more complete pitcher, but the cement isn't totally dry here. A few days before Top 100 publication, the <em>Detroit Free Press</em> reported that Jobe was going to reintegrate a curveball and add a sinker to his repertoire in 2025. He's thrown a handful of them in Grapefruit League action leading up to Tigers list publication, and the pitch looks good; it's 82-84 mph with plus depth and bite, and it has utility as a back door and back foot pitch to lefties, as well as your usual righty chase. Jobe was also sitting 98 out the gate in 2025. Will we see this kind of velocity from him across 120-140 innings? We didn't quite get to know the answer to the workload question in 2024 because of his IL stint, but at the end of the season he looked healthy, nasty, and, from a craftsmanship standpoint, fairly ready to pitch in the big leagues. He is arguably the top pitching prospect in baseball behind Roki Sasaki if you value Jobe's proximity and stability relative to Andrew Painter's upside."
Carson Williams,SS,TBR,2026,10,60,High,21.8,35,35,55,55,"Williams was a two-way high school player who was talented enough to be considered a prospect as both a shortstop and a pitcher. The Rays gave him a $2.3 million bonus to keep him from heading to Cal and have developed him solely as a hitter. During the last three years, Williams has become one of the better prospects in all of baseball, averaging 20 annual homers as a young-for-the-level player who also plays Gold Glove-caliber defense at shortstop. 
In 2024, Williams slashed .256/.352/.469 with 20 bombs and 33 steals in 44 attempts at Double-A Montgomery. That's not to say that Williams is a lock to hit. He's struck out more than 30% of the time so far in pro ball, and he has severe issues contacting breaking balls. The 65-68% contact rates he's posted the last couple of years are scraping the bottom of the big league barrel at shortstop. The players in that area who tend to succeed (a select few: Elly De La Cruz, Oneil Cruz, Ezequiel Tovar) do so because they have enormous tools, and thankfully so does Williams, who is still a fairly skinny 21-year-old and already generating above-average big league power with the flick of his wrists. That and his premium defensive ability are the two attributes that support Williams' entire profile. 
Williams is an unbelievable athlete and flashy shortstop defender who is as creative as he is talented. His range, body control, and plus-plus throwing arm make many tough plays look routine, and make some seemingly impossible plays possible. This defensive ability gives Williams a very high floor. The bummer version of Williams looks something like Adalberto Mondesi, while the version who polishes his hit tool enough to be a consistent All-Star looks more like Willy Adames."
Drake Baldwin,C,ATL,2025,11,55,Med,24,55,55,55,30,"Baldwin signed for just south of $650,000 as the Braves' third rounder in 2022. He slashed .318/.426/.549 throughout his college career in Springfield, had as many walks as strikeouts, and posted a 51% hard-hit rate (Missouri State plays in the same stadium as the Cardinals' Double-A team, so it's fitted with all the tech) in a pretty sizable sample as a junior. As a pro, Baldwin has coasted through the minors, posting a comfortably above-average wRC+ at every level, except for the very start of 2024 at Double-A, where he had some tough BABIP luck. 
Baldwin's ability to move his hands around the zone and spray well-struck contact to all fields is commensurate with an impact primary catcher. He's thick and physical, and rotates with ferocity, and yet his short levers keep his swing from getting too long. He again posted a hard-hit rate up around 50% in 2024, though Baldwin almost exclusively inside-outs fastballs the other way and big league pitchers might be able to limit his game power by attacking him with velocity on the outer third. Though a bunch of his TrackMan data is very similar to that of Dodgers catcher Dalton Rushing, Baldwin's power is not as well-actualized, and stylistically, he looks more like an all-fields doubles hitter. Still, he does a little bit of everything at a position where one thing is often enough. 
Baldwin has made impressive developmental progress on defense. The Braves drastically altered some stylistic elements of his receiving, most notably paring down Baldwin's footwork and putting him more regularly on one knee, and it has taken him some time to get comfortable with that. His receiving and ball blocking are only fair, while the quickness and consistency of his exchange on throws to second base has become excellent. What he lacks in height relative to most catchers, he makes up for in bodily density. He's of sturdy build and caught close to 100 games in 2024 when you take his AFL and Premier12 postseason activity into account. Though he's not currently on the 40-man roster, Baldwin is in position for a 2025 debut, and given Sean Murphy's injury track record (including a recent rib fracture), it's possible he'll get some extended run."
Chase Dollander,SP,COL,2026,12,55,Med,23.4,,,,,"Dollander sat 93-95 mph as a freshman at Georgia Southern, then started throwing harder as a sophomore after he transferred to Tennessee. Throughout 2022 and 2023, he sat 94-97 with riding life and would frequently top out in the 98-99 mph range. In 2024, he sustained that across 23 starts, 118 innings, with the last two months of the season spent at Double-A Hartford. 
Dollander does (or projects to do) everything well. He has plus fastball velocity, as well as the angle/movement traits you want in a power pitcher’s bat-missing heater. He also has a plus-flashing breaking ball in his upper-80s slider, a pitch that wasn't turning the corner as consistently late in 2024, but was dominant early in the year. He can take a little off and show hitters a vertical curveball, too, and both breaking balls have distinct movement. Dollander's changeup is improving despite limited usage. The pacing of his delivery, which has huge acceleration at the very end, should help mask his changeup, which has plenty of action and a chance to be yet another bat-missing pitch for him at peak. Dollander's secondary pitches were dominant during the first half, but weren't as impressive after the All-Star break. By the end of the season, his chase and miss rates were pretty average for his secondaries across the board, but remained outstanding for his fastball. 
A strapping 6-foot-2, Dollander has the frame and delivery of a 160-plus inning workhorse. His line to the plate can waver at times, but for the most part his delivery and release are consistent, and Dollander's fastball is nasty enough to give him lots of margin for error on the days when his command is a little looser. He's going to be an impact mid-rotation guy — and maybe the Rockies' best starter — very soon."
Matt Shaw,3B,CHC,2025,13,55,High,23.4,50,55,60,60,"Shaw is among the twitchiest, most fun to watch players in the minors. A 5-foot-9 stick of dynamite who plays with all-out effort, he has blazed through the minors with relative ease, reaching Triple-A toward the end of his first full pro season. Combined between Double-A Tennessee and Triple-A Iowa, Shaw slashed .284/.379/.488 with 44 extra-base hits (21 of them homers) and 31 steals in 42 attempts, then he was the best hitter on Team USA's Premier12 roster in the fall. 
Perhaps most importantly, the 2024 season gave us growing clarity around Shaw's defensive fit and ability. Shaw exclusively played the middle infield as an amateur, but as a pro, he has begun seeing reps at third base. Shaw sometimes struggles with throwing accuracy and he lacks laser-like arm strength from deep in the hole, but he is otherwise growing into a tremendous third base defender. His lightning-quick exchange helps him shamelessly throw two- and three-hoppers to first base on those deeper throws, his range is exceptional, and he's capable of some very acrobatic stuff. Especially if his feel for throwing from third continues to improve, his ceiling as a defender there is very high. Shaw has also continued to play some shortstop and second base. Dansby Swanson and Nico Hoerner are entrenched on the Cubs' middle infield right now, but the departure of Isaac Paredes in the Kyle Tucker trade clears the runway for Shaw to seize the Opening Day job at third, though he may have to beat out Rule 5 pick Gage Workman during spring training.
Shaw is also an enormously entertaining hitter. He swings like a turbo-charged Sal Bando — closed stance, closed stride, with hands that load very low — except with a huge leg kick, one that is so big and elaborate that it's often hard for him to time. He gets beaten by fastballs up around the belt fairly often, in part because of the path his hands take as a result of his low load, but mostly because his front foot is often late getting down. When he's on time, Shaw is capable of doing all-fields damage, not only because of the explosion created by his whole-body swing, but because of how quick and powerful his wrists are. There are times when the finish to Shaw's swing is abbreviated, à la Chase Utley, but he still smacks the crap out of the ball. That said, opposing pitchers can neuter his power by executing down-and-away from him, where his bat path ends up driving the baseball into the ground; this is why Shaw's game power is graded below his raw. A fair bit of slider chase adds some volatility to Shaw's offensive forecast, but especially with a much more stable and enthusiastic understanding of his defense, he's tracking like an above-average everyday player and foundational young talent."
Jordan Lawlar,SS,ARI,2025,14,55,Med,22.7,40,40,55,70,"Lawlar has been beset by injuries basically since he was drafted. He needed surgery to repair a torn labrum in his shoulder almost immediately after he drove his pro career off the lot, then was sidelined by discomfort caused by a bone growth on one of his ribs in mid-2022, before suffering a fractured left scapula when he was hit by a pitch later that season. Lawlar had a healthy 2023 and cracked the big league roster for the first time, but he didn't hit enough to usurp Evan Longoria during the Snakes' postseason run. He then tore a ligament in his right thumb during 2024 spring training, had surgery, and dealt with recurring hamstring issues a couple of times after he returned. He played just 14 games at an affiliate and was sent to play for Licey in the Dominican Winter League until around Thanksgiving, doubling his 2024 plate appearances to just over 200 total.
Lawlar has a below-average hit tool but does everything else well. He's an acrobatic defender who finds all kinds of crazy ways to contort his body and send the baseball where it has to go, which is especially evident on his feeds to second. Lawlar is often positioned so he can make plays moving right to left, which he's most comfortable with. He struggles to make accurate throws off the backhand, so putting him in position to make as few of those as possible makes a lot of sense. Lawlar got some third base reps with Licey and did fine, putting him on the depth chart at both spots on the infield's left side.  
On offense, Lawlar hit for power when he was healthy at Double-A in 2023, but his exit velocities are shockingly low (and have been for multiple years) given his pedigree and look during BP. He doesn't have great feel for the barrel, and this may be a contact quality issue rather than an actual lack of raw power. His FV grade slid as I worked on the Top 100 as a whole, and got a 10,000 foot view of the entire player population. He's on time to pull lefties with power, and shows gap-to-gap spray against righties. He has plus bat speed, but requires a ton of effort to generate it, often so much that he stops tracking the ball. It's possible that the considerable amount of time Lawlar has missed means that his hit tool will develop late, and that he'll improve enough in this regard to produce offense like Trevor Story or Willy Adames did during their years of team control. At least initially though, his offensive output might look more like like that of Danny Espinosa and Paul DeJong. "
Aidan Miller,SS,PHI,2026,15,55,High,20.8,50,50,60,55,"Miller had a monster first full season, as he slashed .261/.366/.446 across both A-ball levels and got a shot of espresso at Reading to cap the year. Pre-draft fretting over Miller's age relative to his high school peers has evaporated with the pace of his promotion. His explosive hands have lovely lift out in front of the plate, and he adjusts them nicely to breaking stuff. Miller can still roast 'em even when his weight shifts early and his hands are responsible for doing all the damage. Because his hands fire late and take a path that creates scoop and lift, Miller will probably always be vulnerable to fastballs running up around his hands. But he's so dangerous throughout the rest of the zone that his production isn't likely to bottom out because of this issue. 
Defensively, the Phillies have only ever deployed Miller at shortstop. His exchange is a little slow when operating around the bag, and Miller lacks the prototypical, from-the-hole arm strength of a good shortstop, but that's also true of Trea Turner. Miller tends to start deeper toward the hole so he can make the lion's share of his plays moving right to left as a way of masking this issue. It isn't ideal, and I had Miller projected to third base both when he was an amateur and last list cycle, but based on how the Phillies have operated, I have him projected as a below-average shortstop now. Be he a passable shortstop or an average third baseman, Miller's bat is going to enable him to be a damn good everyday player and maybe make a couple All-Star teams. He has a shot to kick down the door and debut in mid-to-late 2025."
Jasson Dominguez,LF,NYY,2025,16,55,Med,22.1,,,,,"Domínguez has played a little bit in the big leagues each of the last two seasons, but a late-2023 Tommy John surgery kept him out for most of 2024 and is why he hasn't yet lost rookie status. Often described on this website as ""Baseball's Zion Williamson,"" Domínguez signed for $5.1 million in 2019 as easily the toolsiest player in his signing class, a plus-running center fielder with huge switch-hitting power. He resembled Zion in both a hype and bodily sense. Domínguez had very mature physicality at a young age. It was and is where his prodigious tools come from, but he was so muscular so young that it was tough to predict what kind of mobility he'd have as he aged into his 20s. He's built like the kind of tightly wound athlete you see grabbing at their hamstring at least once a year. To this point, though, he has been able to keep things in check and remain explosive and mobile, especially in his hips. He's a career .274/.373/.444 hitter in the minors and is poised to assume the playing time left vacant by Juan Soto's crosstown departure. 
Domínguez is going to hit for power. Though he struggled with strikeout issues as a young-for-the-level player while he rocketed through the minors, Domínguez's lefty barrel control was better in 2024 upon his return from TJ, and his contact metrics hovered around average. He's looking to pull from the left side of the dish, while he's a bit more opposite-field oriented from the right side. A shorter-levered guy, Domínguez can wait an extra beat to identify breaking balls, and he crushes the mistakes he sees. 
Where he needs to improve is on defense. Perhaps because he's missed extended time due to injury, Domínguez has sketchy feel for his position. His reads and routes can be wayward, and he looks uncomfortable at the catch point. He runs pretty well, but not well enough to play center field without good instincts and feel. The week of list publication, Yankees manager Aaron Boone told reporters that Cody Bellinger and Aaron Judge will likely push Domínguez to left field, which is probably the best fit for him in a vacuum anyway. A more optimistic contact projection than a year ago outweighs what is lost from Domínguez looking like flub-prone defender, and he should be an above-average everyday outfielder and young, build-around bat."
Walker Jenkins,LF,MIN,2026,17,55,Med,20.1,60,60,55,40,"The fifth pick in the 2023 draft, Jenkins crushed pro ball after signing to the tune of a .362/.417/.571 line, with a 90% z-contact rate during that span. His 2024 regular season got off to a delayed start due to a hamstring strain, which Jenkins suffered in his first game at Fort Myers. He rehabbed on the complex in May, then got 150-ish PA at both Low-A Fort Myers and High-A Cedar Rapids, before ending with a six-game sip of Double-A Wichita. He slashed .282/.394/.439 with just six homers, but 22 doubles and 17 steals in 20 attempts.  
The way Jenkins' hands operate is evocative of Jesse Winker; he has exciting feel to hit and barrel control. He tracks pitches exceptionally well and can move his hands all over the strike zone, snatching fastballs up around his hands to his pull side, or spraying up-and-away fastballs to left field in the air. Jenkins posted an excellent 88% in-zone contact rate and 83% overall contact rate in 2024, backing up his fantastic 2023 debut metrics. There are instances when Jenkins will take what he's offered and make weak groundball contact rather than wait for something he can drive, but he's a very promising young hitter in basically every other way. Though Jenkins lacks big raw power right now, his 6-foot-3 frame has room for muscle and strength, and he should have above-average pop at maturity. The Twins have been deploying Jenkins in center field (when he's not DH'ing, which is frequent), but realistically, he's a left fielder with a 40 arm. He should hit enough to be a heart-of-the-order hitter and impact regular regardless of his position."
Noah Schultz,SP,CHW,2026,18,55,High,21.7,,,,,"On the one hand, it's incredible that Schultz has been able to dominate the mid-minors with one great pitch. On the other hand, it's imperative that his other offerings get better if he's going to hit his ceiling. Schultz is the Oneil Cruz of pitching, so to speak. He has XXL size and a couple premium characteristics, some of which play down in games. He has one of the best sliders in the minors, a 2,900 rpm, 82-85 mph bender from hell with 10-to-4 shape. Schultz should also theoretically be able to run his fastball up the ladder to garner whiffs, because even though he's built like an Andean Condor at a lanky 6-foot-9, his low arm slot gives him a release height of just five-and-a-half feet. But Schultz's fastball, which sits comfortably in the mid-90s, barely ever misses bats; his heater surrendered an 89% zone contact rate in 2024. He also works with a cutter and a changeup, neither of which is good right now. Again, despite these truths, Schultz ran a 2.24 ERA at High- and Double-A last year at age 20. He's freaky and performing, and yet he might just be scratching the surface of his potential. If Schultz can improve the effectiveness of any of his non-slider pitches in 2025, he might be the top pitching prospect in baseball a year from now."
Jarlin Susana,SP,WSN,2026,19,55,High,21,,,,,"While he was still an amateur, Susana had a very, very late velocity spike and progressed from throwing in the mid-80s to the mid-90s in a very short period of time. Because he popped up late relative to his peers, most of the pool money when he was first eligible to sign had already been committed, and he opted to wait a year so that more teams could pursue him with a meaningful bonus. The Padres signed him for $1.7 million and pushed him to camp in Arizona during 2022 minor league spring training. Susana had only pitched in eight official games on the complex before the Padres traded him to Washington as part of the Juan Soto deal. After a walk-prone 2023 (40 free passes in 63 innings) and a rough start to his 2024, Susana appeared to turn a corner in June. He had five dominant starts in a row, was promoted to High-A Wilmington, and then only had two starts the rest of the year in which he walked more than two batters. Susana ended up working 103.2 innings (40 more than the prior season), struck out 35.4% of his opponents, and generated groundballs at a whopping 60% clip. 
It's easy to point to Susana's velocity (which he held basically all year) as an impact attribute, but it's his slider that's easily his best pitch. There are times when it has cutter-movement, but it has eye-crossing downward bend at its best, in the Brad Lidge slider mold, except as hard as 92 mph. It's a slam dunk 80-grade pitch that generated misses just over 50% of the time in 2024. Susana's fastball will touch triple-digits, which is enough for it to dominant A-ball hitters. It lacks great movement or tough angle, and its performance will probably keel off a bit as Susana faces upper-level hitters. He barely used his changeup last year; it's currently a glorified two-seamer in the 92-94 mph range. One out of every 10 or so of Susana's changeups is any good, but he often casts it and it sails on him; the ones that flash have enough tailing action to miss bats. His slider has enough utility as a strike-stealer and finisher against lefties that he might not ever need a changeup, but some kind of splinker/splitter thing might emerge down the line, as tends to be the case for lots of the pitchers today who have lower arm slots like Susana. Now that Susana has began to check the ""durability"" and ""control"" boxes, seemingly at the same time, he's one of the most exciting pitching prospects in baseball. He's a 6-foot-6 Leviathan on track to gobble up NL East hitters in 2027."
Emmanuel Rodriguez,CF,MIN,2025,20,55,Med,22.1,30,30,60,50,"Rodriguez is one of the more entertaining and fascinating prospects in the minors, an incredibly slick defensive center fielder who has plus power and plate discipline. He also has barely played. What would have been Rodriguez's first pro season was squashed by the pandemic and his next two were shortened by knee and abdominal injuries, limiting him to just 84 combined games in his first three years as a pro. A thumb sprain sidelined him for much of 2024 and required surgery in September. 
When healthy, Rodriguez has posted huge stats; he's a .250/.422/.510 hitter in 230 career games. His underlying TrackMan data corroborates the power and OBP aspects of that output. I thought I'd have to go back and use Rodriguez's 2023 data to illustrate this because of his thumb injury, but I don't. Even with a bum digit, he had a 56% hard-hit rate in 2024, and hit a ball 114 mph. He's only chased 10-14% of the time the last two seasons. This is like a turbo-charged version of Trent Grisham, with louder all-fields power but similar patience and defensive ability.
I can't wait for the MLB.TV surfers among you to see this guy play defense. He isn't an elite speedster with huge range; instead, he has incredible skill at the catch point. He makes spectacular plays around the wall and while going to the ground. His reads, routes, instincts and ball skills in center are all spectacular, and right now, he has the foot speed to play there. ""Right now"" is key, however, and this is where Rodriguez's profile takes a bit of a turn and becomes more difficult to wrangle. Almost 22 years old, Rodriguez is already a stocky 5-foot-11, 215 pounds or so. He glides around the outfield with ease at present, but whether that will still be true even three or five years down the line isn't certain because his body is already maxed out. 
The other potential issue here (and this is where his profile also kind of aligns with Grisham's) is that Rodriguez has a well-defined hole in his swing up and away from him; his swing is bottom-hand dominant in the extreme and causes him to swing underneath these pitches with concerning regularity. Rodriguez's compact body helps keep his swing short enough to be on time in the rest of the zone, and his tremendous plate discipline assures that he only hunts pitches he can drive early in counts. Rodriguez's defense will give his offensive flaws room to breath during the periods when he is going through contact dry spells, and across an entire season (assuming Rodriguez will eventually be healthy for one), he should produce like an above-average center fielder."
Ethan Salas,C,SDP,2026,21,55,Med,18.8,40,50,55,40,"Among the most high-profile international amateur prospects of the last decade or so, Salas signed for $5.6 million in January of 2023 and weeks later was in Arizona competing with upper-level minor leaguers and the occasional big leaguer during spring training. He was promoted from the extended spring group to Low-A Lake Elsinore just a few days before his 17th birthday, and he thrived there for most of the rest of his debut season. 
In 2024, he really struggled with the bat at High-A Fort Wayne, posting a paltry .206/.288/.311 line there. He also struggled badly with ball-blocking for a huge chunk of time in the middle of the season and went through a phase of flinching and aversion to the baseball. By the very end of the regular season, this had started to improve, and Salas had a good, if sometimes haggard-looking, six-week run in the Arizona Fall League, hitting .228/.327/.424 with as many homers (four) as he had all year at Fort Wayne as the circuit's second-youngest player. 
It's hard to contextualize Salas' 2024 statistical performance because there isn't much precedent for his promotion pace, and the little that does exist is different due to changes to the structure of the minors. Wander Franco and Vladimir Guerrero Jr. debuted in the Appy League, for instance, rather than in full-season ball like Salas, but both also reached High-A during the back half of their age-18 seasons, and both of them <em>really</em> hit. Salas did not, at least not on the surface. His underlying contact data is better than that of a .206 hitter (77% contact rate, 83% in-zone), but it isn't awesome. Salas' bat path creates some issues, as he's underneath a lot of fastballs away from him and struggles to make good contact against softer stuff. He can snatch fastballs up around his hands, but otherwise isn't a dangerous hitter right now. Salas is still super projectable and is likely to wind up with plus raw power at maturity. If he becomes as good a defender as he's projected here, he can have a one-note offensive skill set and still be a really good player. 
Salas' receiving is incredibly still and quiet, and he'll likely be a great pitch framer at maturity, if he isn't already. His arm is comfortably plus, and the ease and consistency with which he exits his crouch and gets to his release point is unbelievable for anyone, let alone a catcher this age playing several levels above what is typical. The ball-blocking aspect should improve as Salas keeps getting bigger and his body can more comfortably weather the storm of catching. He remains projected as a premium all-around defender with rare raw power for his position, but the hit tool aspect of Salas' profile is tracking below what was considered possible when he first debuted. It's looking less likely Salas will be ""Kyle Tucker, but a Gold Glove catcher."" Instead, his swing is reminiscent of Jason Heyward's and he might have a similar trajectory, where he's merely very good rather than a franchise-altering talent."
Hagen Smith,SP,CHW,2025,22,55,Med,21.6,,,,,"Smith spent his underclass seasons jockeying back and forth between Arkansas' bullpen and rotation, working just over 70 innings each year. Entering the spring of 2024, I thought he had more of a relief look, like a Brooks Raley type, but Smith had an incredible season. He struck out damn near two batters per inning (161 K, 84 IP) and posted a .893 WHIP across 16 starts. A big reason why Smith now not only looks like a slam dunk starter prospect but potentially a top five pick is because of his fastball command, which he sustained throughout the 2024 season even as his velocity climbed. He averaged 95-96 mph, both pre- and post-draft, and touched 100. The rise/run combo of his fastball helps big swing-and-miss results, and Smith's arm stroke (which is both very quick and very low) appears deceptive and makes hitters uncomfortable. It looks like the delivery of a shorter-levered Madison Bumgarner. Smith routinely locates his heater up and to the arm side of the plate, where its movement plays best. Off of that his huge sweeping slider bends in the opposite direction, and Smith commands that too. It doesn't tip its break until very late in flight, and once it starts to move, it moves a ton, sometimes all the way from the arm-side edge of the plate to the dirt in the opposite batter's box. 
Those two pitches were enough for Smith to carve up SEC hitters, but he'll probably need a third pitch to truly hit his ceiling. Right now, he has a changeup that he can control the location of, but it doesn't have great movement. Smith's arm stroke is quick and he has feel for location, so his changeup projection is quite good. He could also take a route similar to Bumgarner and mix in a cutter, which he'd need to develop from scratch. He has mid-rotation projection either way."
Bubba Chandler,SP,PIT,2025,23,55,High,22.5,,,,,"Chandler was a two-sport, two-way high schooler who could have gone to Clemson for baseball and football. Instead he signed for $3 million as the first pick in the 2021 third round and was developed as a two-way player for parts of two seasons before focusing on pitching beginning in 2023. Things have gone very well. Across the last two seasons, Chander has worked at least 110 innings and struck out a little more than a batter per frame, with his walk rate trending down to a little better than the big league average as he climbed to Triple-A in August. He was still sitting 95-98 at the very end of the season, even as he set a career-high mark for innings. 
Chandler's fastball is his best pitch. He hammers the top of the zone with it, and it generated plus chase and miss in 2024. His 86-90 mph changeup has progressed very quickly. It can sometimes sail on him, but it has plus tailing action that misses bats when Bubba keeps it down in the zone, and it can occasionally steal a strike by running back over the corner of the plate even when he mis-releases it. His slider hasn't taken quite the same leap; too often it backs up on him and is hittable despite sitting 88-90 mph. It didn't miss bats consistently in 2024, but its ceiling is still pretty exciting because of how hard Chandler throws it. Though his delivery is a bit more effortful than most big league starters, and he has occasionally struggled with walks as a pro, Chandler's athleticism and multi-sport background make me want to continue projecting on his command deep into his 20s. There's still development happening here (for instance, Chandler made his first start on four days rest in the middle of 2024), but so far, Chandler's dev is going as well as could have been hoped when he was drafted, and he's tracking like a mid-rotation starter. He's entering his 40-man platform year and could debut late in the season so he can retain his rookie eligibility into 2026."
Brandon Sproat,SP,NYM,2025,24,55,Med,24.5,,,,,"Sproat was the Mets' 2022 third rounder, but he didn't sign, opting instead to go back for a fourth year at Florida, where he exceeded 100 innings during the regular season; he was shut down after the Mets drafted him again.  
Sproat was a cross-bodied, lower-slot guy in college, but he's more direct to the plate now, and is throwing from more of a three-quarters slot, giving his fastball rise/run shape rather than the sink/tail of his college days. He has kept throwing hard amid the changes and has been living in the upper-90s without incident for several years. He was still reaching back for 100 late in the 2024 season. The delivery tweaks added depth and diversity to Sproat’s breaking pitches, and he's now attacking with six different offerings. He has a sweeper-shaped slider in the 82-85 mph range, the shape of which he can alter to look more like a cutter, and an upper-70s curveball. He also mixes in two- and four-seam fastballs, and pronates over top of his trademark changeup. Breaking ball consistency was Sproat's biggest issue at Florida and it looks as though the Mets have helped him make an adjustment there. That sweeper is currently his most consistent bat-misser, but I expect Sproat's changeup will also return to being a weapon as he gets feel for this new delivery. His other pitches are deployed with such unpredictability that they'll induce weak contact; he had a 50% groundball rate in 2024. 
After working 116.1 innings and reaching Triple-A Syracuse in 2024, Sproat is on the doorstep of the big leagues and is likely to debut in 2025. He should be a mid-rotation stalwart soon."
Caden Dana,SP,LAA,2025,25,55,Med,21.3,,,,,"Dana signed for just under $1.5 million as an 11th rounder in 2022, and it took him just two years to become a workhorse mid-rotation starter prospect. He had a Herculean 2024 season, as he was able to sustain average velocity for the entire year even though his workload doubled to 146 innings. At just 20 years old, Dana made 23 starts at Double-A (14 of them ""quality starts"") before he had a rocky cup of coffee with the big club in September. 
Dana is built like an innings-eating monster at a muscular 6-foot-4. Though he lacks precise command right now, his delivery is so loose and easy that it's fair to project he'll keep improving in this area and develop plus command of his four-pitch repertoire as he enters his prime. Dana's best pitch is his slider, which resides in the 84-88 mph range and can be used to garner chase, or as a backdoor offering against lefties. He flashed a good changeup during his brief big league call-up — its power sink even made Kyle Tucker and Yordan Alvarez miss badly — but his feel for dotting it in enticing locations isn't as consistent as it is for his other pitches (yet). Still, given how loose and easy his delivery is, it eventually should be. 
The biggest change to Dana's report compared to last cycle concerns his fastball grade. I was too worried about its in-zone viability on my last pass. It played great in the zone in 2024 and, considering how he held his arm strength under a massive innings increase, he might have another gear of velo in him once he gets used to working this much. Plus, it looks like he's going to command it to the locations in which it plays best. Dana is basically big-league ready as he approaches his age-21 season and projects as a mid-rotation stalwart in the Germán Márquez mold."
Bryce Eldridge,1B,SFG,2026,26,55,High,20.4,40,50,70,30,"Eldridge is a human skyscraper at 6-foot-7 and has some of the most exciting raw power projection in all the minors. In his first full pro season, split pretty evenly between Low- and High-A, he hit .289/.372/.513 with 23 home runs. Then the Giants gave him two model-jobbing promotions to Double-A Richmond and Triple-A Sacramento; Eldridge played fewer than 10 games at each stop before he was sent to the Arizona Fall League, where he looked absolutely exhausted (especially on defense). 
Eldridge is going to have enormous power in the Matt Olson/Adam Dunn zip code one day. He already has plus raw — 111 mph max velo, 106 mph EV90, 56% hard-hit rate in 2024 — and still has a ton of room on his frame for mass and strength. Any time a hitter this size comes along, there are justifiable doubts about whether or not he'll be able to catch up to big league velocity, and while Eldridge is definitely going to have elevated strikeouts throughout his career, he also has a remarkably short swing for a hitter his size, and he has shown an ability to move the barrel around the zone. He still had more swings and misses than balls in play in 2024, which is often a scary indicator, but while his contact metrics are a full standard deviation below the big league average — 16% swinging strike rate, 77% in-zone contact, 67% overall — there's just too much playable power here to fret over that. 
Where Eldridge most needs to improve before he dons a big league uniform is on defense. It's no doubt exhausting for a guy this size to bend and get deep into his lower body all summer, but by the end of the year, Eldridge was playing first base with such a high center of gravity that it often cost his team outs. There are times when he fails to stretch enough on a bang-bang play, or comes off the bag entirely because he can't stretch enough, and this happens way more often than is acceptable at the big league level. Eldridge doesn't have to be doing the splits at first to be a fine defender, but he definitely needs to learn how to hold the bag better. The Giants have tried him in right field (Eldridge was also a marginal pitching prospect in high school, and his arm would play there), but not at all in 2024; he seems like a first base-only prospect now. This guy is going to be a middle-of-the-order force, so it doesn't really matter where he plays and it barely matters how good a defender he becomes, but it's the aspect of his game that needs the most help right now. It's plausible Eldridge will be up late in 2025, late enough for him to retain rookie eligibility entering 2026. Like your balsa wood bridge from shop class, if Eldridge's hit tool can pass the test of upper-level pitching, he'll be a top 10 prospect by that time."
Jacob Misiorowski,SP,MIL,2026,27,55,High,23,,,,,"Misiorowski's velocity climbed throughout the lead up to the 2022 draft; he was sitting 91-93 early in the year, but by the time the Combine rolled around, he was touching 100. Misiorowski quickly added a second breaking ball to his repertoire upon his entry to pro ball, and he's been able to sustain upper-90s arm strength amid a 20-inning uptick in each of the last two years. He threw just shy of 100 innings in 2024 and was put in the bullpen late in the year as a way of limiting his workload (and in the event that the Brewers needed him out of the 'pen for a playoff run). He'll be sent out as a starter again in 2025. 
Miz is incredibly nasty — even at the end of 2024, his fastball was averaging 98 mph and touching 101 — but he has walked 13-15% of opposing hitters at each minor league level. He is a gangly and wiry 6-foot-7, incredibly loose and explosive, and simply hasn't developed sufficient body control to throw strikes yet. Because Misiorowski was a junior college draft pick, he's pretty young — as you're reading this Top 100 blurb, he's still 22 years old, with stuff is so overwhelming that he has K'd 30% of Double- and Triple-A hitters. Both of his breaking balls added velocity in 2024; his curveball was averaging 85 mph once he got to Nashville, and he threw some 93-95 mph cutters during that time. There's definitely risk that Misiorowski will go the way of Nate Pearson, another junior college pick with enormous stuff who not only hasn't figured things out enough to start, but has also struggled in relief. That's the floor here. But this is extra-planetary stuff we're talking about, and Misiorowski is much more loose and sinewy than Pearson, and should have superior athletic longevity. Even if Miz ends up in the bullpen, he could be an Edwin Díaz-type closer. If he polishes his strike-throwing enough to start, then there really isn't anyone to compare him to."
Chase Burns,SP,CIN,2025,28,55,High,22.2,,,,,"Burns was one of those pitchers who was already touching 100 as a high schooler and throwing with such effort and violence that teams were standoffish and generally had him pref'd in the comp round. That wasn't high enough for Burns to sign, and he ended up at Tennessee where, after a great freshman season as a starter, he was squeezed out of a talented rotation as a sophomore (but was great in high-leverage long relief). Burns transferred to Wake Forest (renowned for its pitching development) for his junior year and had an incredible season (100 innings, 96 baserunners, 191 strikeouts) but missed out on a national title. He went wire-to-wire as maybe the best pitching prospect in the 2024 draft class and could feasibly be in the big leagues early in 2025.
Burns has been able to sustain elite velocity for his entire career, and the way his pitches work together when he is commanding them (which is kind of an issue) is stylistically similar to Justin Verlander and Hunter Brown. While he's a more tightly wound athlete than most front end big league starters, Burns otherwise has prototypical size and physicality. He will probably grow more and more barrel-chested as he ages; his frame started creeping that way late in college. Burns uses big spinal tilt to get to an extreme vertical arm slot that, in concert with his size, gives his fastball huge downhill plane. Even at his velocities (he averaged 98 and touched 101 in 2024), this causes his fastball to be hittable when it's in the meat of the zone and below. He needs to command it more consistently to the upper boundary of the strike zone for that pitch to max out. If he can, then we're in Verlander pitch mix territory because of the way Burns' secondary stuff can play off of that fastball location. 
His high arm slot makes it very difficult to spot breaking balls popping out of Burns' hand because they're always descending. His slider has nasty vertical depth for a pitch in the 87-90 mph range and can be used to get strike one, or deployed like a cutter in on the hands of lefties, or as a finishing pitch in the dirt. His curveball gives him a second, slower version of everything, but it's not nearly as nasty as the slider. It's tough to turn over a changeup from his arm slot, so Burns doesn't — his slot lowers when he throws his change, and his best cambios are a well-located 45-grade offering. Because of the way his breaking balls play versus lefties, this shouldn't be an issue in pro ball, though it wouldn't hurt to have a good changeup. Burns' mechanical operation requires a lot of effort and it detracts from his command. It's possible he'll continue to refine the feel for his body and release as he matures (he's a 22-year-old kid throwing 100 for goodness sake), but it certainly wasn't a polished part of his game as of draft time. He's a pretty good bet to become a mid-rotation starter and has front-end upside if his command gets better."
Alfredo Duno,C,CIN,2028,29,55,High,19.2,35,30,70,40,"Duno is one of the freakier prospects in baseball, a tool shed 6-foot-3-ish catcher with elite power potential and and eye-popping speed for someone so big. His titanic size and strength, as well as his remarkable athleticism for such a huge teenager, give Duno both extraplanetary power potential and room to forecast huge growth on defense. 
After a 2023 pro debut in the DSL, the Reds skipped Duno over the domestic complex and sent him straight to Low-A Daytona in 2024. There Duno slashed .267/.367/.422 with a 28.8% K% in 32 games before he broke a rib and was shut down for the rest of the year. Duno looked like he was starting to get a feel for how to use his size on defense in the couple of weeks leading up to his injury, and this was especially true when it came to ball-blocking. Duno's mobility for a catcher his size is incredible, and the way he can bend and explode out of his crouch to field his position is very exciting. His throwing has not been as good as was advertised when he first signed. He dealt with elbow issues in 2023 (which is why he didn't catch that year), and he hasn't shown a consistently plus hose stateside, though some of that is because his footwork coming out of his crouch has been so inconsistent. It's something to watch, but the way Duno progressed on defense in his little bit of healthy 2024 play was very positive overall. 
At the plate, Duno is still getting a feel for his volcanic bat speed and bodily verve, but holy cow, can this guy swing it. He has plus raw power right now at age 19 and is going to grow into more. He's big but not maxed out, built like Heliot Ramos scaled up four inches. Duno is also shockingly fast, and not just for his size, posting some run times to first base near 4.25 seconds in his limited action. Duno presents one of the most exciting toolsets in all of minor league baseball, but he hasn't played very much yet, and whether or not his strikeout issues can improve via regular reps will dictate how good he becomes. He's a risky prospect with superstar ceiling, and my tape study of his defense was encouraging enough to say that he raised his floor in 2024 even though he didn't get the opportunity to race up the minor league ladder."
Adrian Del Castillo,C,ARI,2025,30,50,Med,25.5,50,45,55,20,"Del Castillo looked like he might be the best catcher in his draft class and a potential future top 10 pick during his freshman year at Miami, a season that saw him also play some third base and right field. A COVID-shortened sophomore campaign meant he didn't get the opportunity to repeat that performance and solidify his spot in the class, and then Del Castillo regressed as a hitter during his junior season and was a buy-low of sorts at pick no. 67. After a rough, strikeout-prone introduction to pro ball in 2021 and 2022, Del Castillo has been raking, and debuted with the big league club late in 2024. The hitting environments at Arizona's upper-minors affiliates — Amarillo and Reno — should generate some skepticism about his overall statline from the last two seasons, but importantly, Del Castillo posted a career-best strikeout rate (by a huge margin) in 2024, and his strength and conditioning looks as though it has taken a meaningful step forward. 
Del Castillo still has some issues on defense. Most significantly, his 2.05-ish second pop times are at the bottom of what tends to be acceptable for a regular catcher (he hasn't played other positions as a pro). His excellent accuracy makes up for this to some extent, but he has allowed a career 80% stolen base success rate in the minors, with a 93% success rate on 29 attempts during his call-up to Phoenix. Other aspects of Del Castillo's defense are also below average, but not so bad that he needs to change positions. Speedy opposing offenses will turn games against him into a track meet, but with Gabriel Moreno entrenched as the primary guy, los Serpientes get to pick their spots with the way Del Castillo is deployed. 
He's going to hit enough to justify some DH/1B reps, too, and depending on whether Arizona re-signs or replaces Joc Pederson and Christian Walker, Del Castillo could see 400 PA in 2025 as a combo backup catcher and platoon DH. He can still be beaten by well-executed fastballs up and away from him, but you had better put it there because he can do damage throughout the rest of the zone, especially against stuff on the inner half. His added strength shows in his TrackMan stats, as Del Castillo's measurable power has taken a leap in two consecutive years; for example, his hard-hit rate has risen from 29% to 46% during that time. The big question here is whether Del Castillo's significant improvement in strikeout rate will hold multi-year water. It's logical that the added strength has had an impact on Del Castillo's raw power, but has it also somehow made him a more skilled hitter? His batting stance changed somewhat in 2024, but the rest of his swing really hasn't. He has always had lovely hitting hands, and he tracks and identifies breaking stuff, he just struggles to get on top of a somewhat large subset of heaters. Were Del Castillo definitely a ""no"" at catcher, then maybe a strikeout rate regression to his career norm would be something to fear, but there's enough playable power here for him to be considered a primary catching prospect in a vacuum."
Nick Kurtz,1B,ATH,2026,31,50,Med,22,55,60,60,30,"A gigantic individual with enormous strength, Kurtz's performance plateaued during his junior year at Wake, but he still clubbed more than 20 homers for the second consecutive season and posted a 1.294 OPS. The A's made him the fourth overall pick and The Colonel reached Double-A by the end of the summer and then picked up Arizona Fall League reps. This is an upward re-evaluation of Kurtz compared to his pre-draft grade, which had him more in the middle of the first round. 
Kurtz does some special stuff and has some unique physical characteristics that make him effective. He has plus power generated by big time thunder in his hands, and his swing features a back-side collapse, which creates power-producing loft. Despite his size, Kurtz is a short-levered guy. His front arm basically bars as he loads his hands, but his T-Rex levers help keep his swing from getting too long. He has terrific vertical plate coverage and is a threat to do damage all over the zone. Big league pitchers are likely to attack Kurtz on the outer third with fastballs and changeups, which his short levers/open stride combo sometimes cause him to swing inside. Concerns about covering the outer third of the zone were a big part of why Eric was lower on Kurtz before the draft, but while he does his fair share of whiffing in that location, he's also incredibly dangerous to the opposite field when pitchers don't quite execute there. His college (87% z-contact%, 80% overall contact) and post-draft data (86% in-zone, 76% contact, 8% SwStr%) reinforce confidence in his contact ability. 
Kurtz isn't a great athlete or bender, and he plays defense with a high center of gravity but scouts love his first base defense. He might have a relatively short shelf life as an athlete because he's such a big guy, but now isn't the time to fret about that. In the immediate future, Kurtz is likely to race to the big leagues and produce like an impact heart-of-the-order hitter at 1B."
Quinn Mathews,SP,STL,2025,32,50,Low,24.5,,,,,"The Cardinals gave Mathews $600,000 as a senior sign in the fourth round of the 2023 Draft after he threw 124.2 innings as Stanford’s Friday night starter. He struck out 158 batters and, infamous 2023 postseason pitch counts aside, he was viewed as a very safe, changeup-oriented backend starter prospect whose ceiling was capped by well-below-average velocity. 
Then, ho hum, Mathews had a significant velocity spike in 2024 and led the minors in strikeouts. I'm buying that Mathews’ uptick in velocity (he averaged 91 in his final year at Stanford and was sitting 93-96 last year) is for real because it was accompanied by a physical change. This guy has been doing glute bridges and such; his lower body has gotten much, much stronger. He's also not being ridden as hard as he was at Stanford, though his workload in college primed him to pitch 143.1 innings in his debut season as a pro. He's among the most stretched-out, fully-baked pitching prospects in the minors, and could handle a full big league season workload this year if he had to. 
Mathews' secondary stuff remains strong. His slider has also enjoyed an uptick in velocity, climbing from 79-81 mph in college to 83-86 mph in pro ball, and touching above that. His changeup was a legit bat-missing offering in college and remains so. It plays very well off his fastball, solid arm speed sells the pitch, and it has late, sinking action. None of this has had a detrimental impact on Quinn's command, or his mechanical look. He's still a super smooth operator who takes a consistent, direct line to the plate and fills the zone. He is on pace to do what Tanner Bibbee did in Cleveland: race to the big leagues in a mid-rotation capacity after looking like the most vanilla of backend starters just a year before."
Angel Genao,2B,CLE,2027,33,50,High,20.9,55,50,55,50,"Genao still has some issues to solve on defense before he can be considered a shortstop fit, as his arm strength and accuracy remain sketchy. But the good news is that it might not matter where he ends up playing defense, because Genao is starting to get stronger and deliver brutal blows to the baseball, which should enable him to profile at second or third base if it comes to that. He slashed a BABIP-aided .330/.379/.499 split between the two A-ball levels last season. Genao, who turns 21 in mid-May, has one of the cooler looking swings in prospectdom, a somewhat elaborate, full-body hack with a big finish behind him. He's more skilled as a lefty, but he can damage mistakes from either side. Aspects of Genao's swing might leave him vulnerable around his hands once he starts facing good velocity, but for now Genao (pronounced jen-OW) looks like an everyday middle infield performer in every statistical category. He's a sneaky bet to wind up in the top 20 of next year's list."
Max Clark,CF,DET,2027,34,50,Med,20.3,60,60,45,70,"Clark was a well-known, top-of-his-class high schooler several years before he was draft eligible because of his consistent, superlative performance in travel ball tournaments. He entered pro ball as a dynamic, old school leadoff hitter prospect, and so far that's exactly what he looks like. Clark spent most of his first full pro season at Low-A Lakeland and was promoted to High-A West Michigan for the final month and a half of 2024. In 107 combined games, he slashed .279/.372/.421 and tallied 36 extra-base hits and 29 steals in 33 attempts. 
Clark's lightning-quick hitting hands are best at snatching pitches around the top of the strike zone. He slices and hooks lots of hard, low-lying contact from line to line, then uses his speed to take extra bases. His swing doesn't feature big lift, and Clark lacks overt, frame-based power projection, but the amount of contact he makes and its quality should enable him to hit for plenty of in-game power in pro ball — it will just likely manifest as 40 or 50 doubles rather than 30-plus home runs. 
Clark still has some developing to do in center field. He easily has the speed to play the position well, but he often looks uncomfortable at the catch point. None of Clark's underlying data is particularly nutty when compared to big league averages, but it's impressive across the board for an up-the-middle player his age. He's still tracking like a traditional leadoff-hitting center fielder with a well-rounded game."
Alex Freeland,SS,LAD,2025,35,50,Low,23.6,50,45,55,50,"For those who consider bat-to-ball skills to be an innate ability, I present Freeland, who had a 67% contact rate in 2023 and a 78% rate in 2024. This delta is most pronounced from the left side, as Freeland's contact rate as a lefty was 70% in 2023 and a miraculous 80% in 2024. His left-handed swing appears toned down relative to 2023 (he's gone from a leg kick to a toe tap), and in 2024, he climbed three levels to Triple-A while slashing .260/.387/.442. Freeland still swings hard and is capable of leaving the yard to all fields. He's gotten better at covering the upper part of the strike zone from the left side, though his righty swing is much less dynamic and only geared for low-ball contact. Freeland's excellent arm strength makes him a shortstop fit on defense despite below-average range. Without an obvious shortstop on the Dodgers big league roster, Freeland is in position to play a very important big league role in 2025 and might be the club's long-term answer at that position."
Travis Bazzana,2B,CLE,2025,36,50,Low,22.6,55,60,55,60,"A six-sport athlete at Turramurra High School (about 20 minutes north of the Sydney Opera House), Bazzana ran track (100m dash, long jump and high jump), played soccer, basketball, and rugby, lettered in cricket from grades seven (!) through 12, was captain of his high school's state championship cricket team, and was on Australia's U18 Baseball World Cup roster in 2019. He was immediately a good college hitter at Oregon State, where he slashed .360/.497/.660 throughout his career and .407/.568/.911 as a junior with 28 homers and only 37 strikeouts. The Guardians made him the first overall pick in the 2024 draft and Bazzana struck out at a surprising 25.4% clip in 122 PA at High-A, twice what he did before the draft.
A compact athlete cut from the same cloth as Rougned Odor and Brian Dozier, Bazzana has terrific plate coverage, with power and swing loft that ensures he gets to it in games. This guy can bang to all fields. Short levers enable Bazzana to turn on inside pitches with power (this is where he's most dangerous), while his raw strength and bat speed give him oppo-gap doubles pop. Bazzana has an uphill, damage-causing bat path all over the zone, and his lower body can dip to help him scoop low pitches.
Though he runs well in a straight line, Bazzana is not an especially graceful mover, nor a very good second base defender. He's a 40-grade athlete in space, with below-average hands and arm strength. Very similar to JJ Wetherholt, Bazzana lacks the size of your typical impact big leaguer, but à la Rougie, there's plenty of precedent for a guy like this succeeding. Considering his non-traditional baseball background, it's conceivable that Bazzana still has room for growth as a hitter as he gains high-level experience. Athletic limitations make it tough to forecast the same kind of growth on defense, but Bazzana has been an ""arrow up"" guy for the last three seasons, and should be a good everyday second baseman even if he isn't a great defender."
Leodalis De Vries,SS,SDP,2028,37,50,High,18.5,45,40,60,50,"De Vries was unanimously viewed as the best prospect in the 2024 international signing class, a do-everything, switch-hitting infielder with power from both sides of the plate. At the time, there were international scouting folks whose club reports on De Vries said ""everything is at least plus,"" and who considered him a no-doubt shortstop with a 60- or 70-grade arm and a projectable frame; one executive considered him the best international prospect in more than a half decade. Same as they have with their recent high-profile prospects, the Padres wasted no time in pushing De Vries' promotion pace. Most prospects who sign in a given year spend all of the rest of it in the D.R. getting their feet wet in pro ball. De Vries was on the Peoria complex weeks after he signed, and after a little bit of extended spring training action, he was sent out to Low-A Lake Elsinore when he was roughly 17 1/2. He slashed .237/.361/.441 at Elsinore before wrapping up his season in the Arizona Fall League. 
De Vries doesn't have great range or footspeed, and he isn't a great bender, but basically everything else he's doing at shortstop is great. He has one hell of an arm, which helps him make up for his lack of range to a degree, and he's an acrobatic and creative defender capable of making highlight reel plays around the bag and in the hole to his right. I have him evaluated as a skill-based fit at short, but how his body and mobility develop as he ages is definitely something to monitor. If he has to move to, say, third base, it's plausible he could be an amazing defender there. 
On offense, De Vries can bang from both sides of the plate. He has remarkably consistent feel for elevation and enough power to be dangerous already at age 18. Both swings are fairly grooved, which is pretty typical for a switch-hitter this age, but De Vries is going to damage mistakes that run into his bat path. His contact performance — 80% in-zone, 72% overall — is south of what is typical for a big league shortstop, but it isn't terrible, especially with his age and level in mind. De Vries hit exclusively left-handed for a stretch in late May and then returned to switch-hitting, and most of his homers came from the right side. This is a very talented young fella with the potential to be an impact middle infielder. The range of outcomes is pretty big. He could be an Ozzie Albies type of power-hitting second baseman, or an Asdrúbal Cabrera type shortstop, or a Wilson Betemit type of third baseman except with much better defense. Most of the outcomes are good so long as De Vries fine-tunes his game the way most teenage hitters have to."
Jesus Made,2B,MIL,2029,38,50,Med,17.9,55,60,60,45,"Made was on the 2024 International Players section of The Board because the heuristics with which I approach that market gravitate toward switch-hitting up-the-middle guys with contact feel, even when they're relatively small dudes. Made has become quite strong very quickly and has already shattered my expectations. He torched the 2024 DSL with one of the league's more cartoonish all-time statlines — .331/.458/.554 with 21 extra-base hits in 51 games. His underlying TrackMan data was even more absurd — 90% in-zone contact, 89% overall contact, 15% chase, 108 mph max exit velo, 104 mph EV90, 47% hard-hit rate — especially when you consider Made's age. Some of these marks are comfortably two standard deviations above the big league average. They are, of course, tough to contextualize given the nature of DSL pitching, but for the most part, Made's visual scouting report backs up the notion that he's a very talented young hitter. He has filled out and looks much stronger in his lower body now than he did when he was an amateur prospect, and he's on a path where his physicality could be in the Robinson Canó or Ketel Marte area at maturity. The fluidity in Made's hips as he swings and the authority in his hands through contact are both remarkable. He's capable of impacting the baseball with lift in most of the zone (including when he's crowded around his hands), and his swing has a gorgeous finish. 
The ease and stillness with which Made can swing hard is pretty special. He did struggle some with velocity, and guys with swings naturally geared for low-ball contact like Made's sometimes have issues that we simply don't know about when they're in the DSL because the pitching there isn't good enough to illuminate them. But if Made were a domestic high school prospect, we'd absolutely be talking about him as the potential top overall pick in this year's draft. He's a potential do-everything middle infielder (he's played 2B/SS/3B so far) with a special hit/power combination. The Brewers have been pretty aggressive about promoting their top DSL guys directly to full-season ball the following season, so Made is arguably priority no. 1 for me on the backfields during spring training, since he's unlikely to stick around for extended."
Alejandro Rosario,SP,TEX,2026,39,50,High,23.2,,,,,"A very famous prospect since his high school underclass days, Rosario's mid-to-upper-90s fastball used to miss frustratingly few bats because of its shape. He ran an ERA over 7.00 during both his sophomore and junior years, sitting 95-96 and flashing a plus slider and splitter. The Rangers quickly overhauled Rosario's delivery, most notably his arm slot, which is now much more vertical. It's totally changed the way Rosario's fastball plays without sacrificing his arm strength or the quality of either secondary pitch, and it also improved his command. In a 2024 split evenly between Low- and High-A, he posted a 36.9% K%, a 3.7%(!) BB%, and a 2.24 ERA across 88.1 innings. 
This is an ""I'll have what she's having"" situation. There are many people in baseball who are jealous of the Rangers for this one, and others who think Rosario should be furious with the staff at Miami for failing to help him improve in college, as it probably cost him a lot of money (Andrew Walters, too). Rosario's line to the plate is much more direct and comfortable looking now than when he was in college. His mid-90s fastballs (Rosario mixes four- and two-seamers) have a flat enough angle to beat hitters above the zone even though they lack great ride. His breaking ball has morphed into a nasty two-plane slider that looks more like a curve when Rosario lands it in the zone, and his splitter (which sits about 90 mph) garnered an elite whiff rate in 2024. In less than a year, Rosario has gone from a frustrating Day Two prospect to a potential mid-rotation starter with three plus pitches. He could be the best pitching prospect in baseball a year from now if he proves he can sustain this performance across another 30 or innings while facing upper-level sticks. "
AJ Smith-Shawver,SP,ATL,2025,40,50,High,22.4,,,,,"A two-sport Texas Tech commit coming out of high school, Smith-Shawver raced to the big leagues in his second full season even as his repertoire and delivery were evolving. His strike-throwing stagnated during a homer-prone 2024 at Triple-A, but the barely-22-year-old Smith-Shawver (who also dealt with a grade two oblique strain last year) still checks basically every athletic box you're looking for in an impact pitcher and he hasn't focused solely on baseball for very long. Since he was drafted, the Braves have augmented AJ's release point and, in 2022, altered the shape of his slider. In 2023, he added a mid-70s rainbow curveball that complements the shape of his riding mid-90s fastball. In 2024, he suddenly had a plus-flashing changeup. For Smith-Shawver to have entered pro ball as a fastball/slider projection guy and, amidst all these changes, reached the big leagues before he was legally allowed to drink is remarkable. 
A super loose 6-foot-3, Smith-Shawver's mechanical consistency should improve with reps. His fastball's velocity and ride give it margin for error in the strike zone, but his secondary pitches (especially his slider) need to be located more consistently if they're going to thrive. The developmental imperative for AJ and the Braves is to find more consistent slider release so that that pitch is located off the plate rather than constantly backing up into the wheelhouse of righty batters. 
I'm consciously avoiding prospect fatigue here — were Smith-Shawver a college righty sitting 95 mph with his changeup quality, we'd be talking about him as a lock to be a top 10 pick. The Braves' aggressive promotion schedule has backed them into a bit of a corner here, as Smith-Shawver has just one option year left, which might impact his role in the short-term. Over time, however, I think he'll be a good mid-rotation starter with two plus pitches and, eventually, much better command than he has right now."
Colt Emerson,3B,SEA,2027,41,50,Med,19.7,55,55,50,40,"Emerson had a loud introduction to pro ball in 2023, as he and the Mariners' other high school draftees from that year's class made noise in Modesto. His 2024 was more muted, in part because Emerson missed significant time with a foot fracture during the regular season (and looked slower on defense when he returned), and then was shut down during his Arizona Fall League stint (he raked there) because of a strained hammy. He is now a career .290/.419/.419 hitter in 94 minor league games. 
Emerson's hitting hands are lovely and explosive, working in an aesthetically pleasing loop that creates natural all-fields doubles power. He posted an 87% in-zone contact rate in 2024, and he has terrific feel for the strike zone. As sexy as his swing looks, I'm a tad worried about how his bat path will play against better velocity. Hitters with swings like this tend to cut underneath a lot of right-handed fastballs up-and-away from them. Still, you should keep in mind that Emerson will (probably, hopefully) be going from one extreme hitting environment to another in 2025 as he transitions from Everett to Arkansas, so even if his numbers take a dive, it doesn't necessarily mean that I'm already right about that. 
Emerson is a little too heavy-footed to play shortstop for me. He can throw from tough platforms but is a little too slow-twitch to be a big league shortstop. The Mariners gave him a little run at third base in 2024, and I think that's his most likely eventual home. That will make it a little more important for Emerson to get to more power than he has to this point, but there should still be enough offense here for him to profile as an average everyday option there."
Chase Petty,SP,CIN,2025,42,50,High,22,,,,,"Petty, who touched 102 in high school, came to the Reds from Minnesota during the spring of 2022 in a trade for Sonny Gray. After missing time with an elbow issue in 2023, he had a healthy and complete 2024 season in which he worked 137 innings spent mostly at Double-A Chattanooga, many more frames than he had thrown in any prior year. At the very end of the season, after Petty had been promoted to Louisville, his fastball was still sitting 94-97 mph. 
Petty is an incredible on-mound athlete whose body whips around like a tornado throughout his delivery, which looks like a more consistent version of Abner Uribe's. He has never had issues throwing strikes, and now he's proven he can sustain plus arm strength under the stress of a starter's load of innings. Another big development for Petty is that he's altered his approach with his heater. He formerly used it as a low-in-the-zone sinker, but is now peppering the top of the strike zone with it. Off of that, he works with a low-90s cutter, a mid-80s slider, and a mid-80s changeup. The two-plane version of Petty's slider is his nastiest pitch, while his cutter and changeup are more about inducing weak contact from lefties. If Petty can continue on this mid-rotation path, he'll stand apart from the routine failures that most of the hardest throwing high school pitchers in the draft endure. He's a special athlete with special arm strength and seemed to make relevant tweaks in 2024, while simultaneously increasing confidence that he can actually start by holding his stuff all year. There's a pretty good chance he debuts at some point in 2025, though he may not exhaust rookie eligibility until 2026."
Agustin Ramirez,C,MIA,2025,43,50,High,23.6,45,50,60,30,"In part because of the pandemic and in part because of the crowded field of Yankees catching prospects above him, it took Ramirez four years to exit rookie ball, which he did during a breakout 2023 that saw him climb from Low- to Double-A. In 2024, Ramirez slugged his way to another promotion with a monster .289/.372/.570 first half at Somerset, and he spent a month in Scranton before the Yankees traded him to Miami as part of the Jazz Chisholm Jr. deal. 
The 2024 season was Ramirez's first on the 40-man roster and, due to his immaturity on defense, it was a purely developmental season that used one of his option years. His receiving around the edge of the zone and pure arm strength are both fine, but Ramirez is currently pretty bad at picking balls in the dirt, and his slow exit from his crouch drags his pop times down into a slightly below-average range. He isn't ready to be a big league defender just yet, but he also isn't so bad that he has to slide to first base. 
This is still a young catcher with rare power at a position where players tend to break late. Ramirez has big bat speed and power, and enough plate coverage to weaponize it. He's maintained modest strikeout rates despite a max-effort style of swinging, with the finish of Agustin's backswing so big that it's often incredibly dangerous for the catcher behind him. He is going to do enough damage to warrant starts at first base and DH like Ryan Jeffers has — essentially an everyday player who catches some of the time. Expect Ramirez to get his feet wet at the big league level in 2025 and get regular at-bats at C/1B/DH, then establish himself as Miami's primary catcher as soon as he gets a little better at playing defense."
Thayron Liranzo,C,DET,2027,44,50,High,21.7,40,35,60,30,"Liranzo is a huge-framed, power-hitting catching prospect with several very raw attributes. He was part of the Dodgers' Wilman Diaz/Rayne Doncon/Josue De Paula position player group on the complex and in Rancho Cucamonga, where Liranzo hit 24 bombs in 2023. Promoted to the High-A Midwest League in 2024, Liranzo struggled early in the season, as many hitters in that league do when they shift from training in Arizona to playing in 40 degree weather in Michigan; he hit .159 in April but slashed .262/.399/.424 the rest of the year. He was traded to Detroit as part of the Jack Flaherty deadline swap, went on a torrid run after the deal, and then continued to rake in the Arizona Fall League. 
Liranzo is what I'd call a Michael Myers Prospect: slow-moving but inevitable. He's raw enough that as he enters 2025, his 40-man platform year, he’s probably still a couple of seasons away from reaching the big leagues, and will need a few more after that to hit his ceiling. Chief among Liranzo's developmental imperatives are his ball-blocking and throwing accuracy. When he has a clean exchange, Liranzo's arm is lethal. He has uncommon athleticism for a guy his size and is capable of firing rockets from his knees or from funky arm angles, à la Patrick Bailey, with some pop times hovering around 1.80 seconds late in the 2024 season. So why has Liranzo allowed stolen bases at an 85% clip the last two years? He too often fumbles his exchange and can't even get a throw off, or has the carry on his throw impacted by having a poor grip on the baseball. His stone-handed issues are evident when he tries to pick short hops, too, though Liranzo began receiving on one knee in 2024 and is learning how to use his size as a ball-blocking barrier from this body position. The physical tools to not only be a viable catcher, but a very good one, are here, and Liranzo is built like a lot of other late-blooming catchers whose size tends to win the war of attrition they're all constantly fighting. 
We can be hopeful that Liranzo will make similar progress on offense. He already has plus power from both sides of the plate at age 21 and will probably have another grade of it at his peak. He isn't a skilled hitter — Liranzo's swing is grooved and he's looking to run into mistakes that find the very middle of the zone — but he is very dangerous from both sides of the plate if he gets one. Again, we must remember this scouting axiom: Switch-hitters tend to develop late, as they have two swings they need to get a feel for. There's evidence this has been happening for Liranzo. His contact rates improved four percentage points (both overall and in the strike zone) in 2024 compared to 2023, though at 69% and 77%, respectively, both marks would rank near the bottom of the primary catcher population. The natural launch in Liranzo's best swings combined with his ability to mis-hit contact with enough strength to produce whoopsie doubles should allow him to get to power even though he's going to strike out a ton. Projected as a flawed-but-good primary catcher overall, Liranzo should have some peak power-hitting seasons that make him an All-Star."
Coby Mayo,1B,BAL,2025,45,50,High,23.3,40,45,65,40,"Mayo had a five-year track record of mashing dating back to high school before elevated strikeouts began to creep into his profile once he was promoted to Double-A. Since arriving in Bowie and then Norfolk, his K% has hovered around 25%, while Mayo's underlying contact rate has slowly dipped into a problematic range, from 75% to 73% to 70%, as he's progressed up the minor league ladder the last three years. Mayo's funky, pull-heavy swing generates enormous pull-side power and loft, and he's on time to destroy fastballs (his splits against plus velocity are great) even though he's a massive, long-levered 6-foot-5 guy. His tendency to pull off toward the third base side has left him very vulnerable to sliders on the outer half, and as Mayo has faced more sentient pitching at the upper levels, that has been more consistently exploited. In spite of this, Mayo crushed Triple-A (.287/.364/.562) at age 22, including after he returned from a month-long IL stint due to a fractured rib. He looked positively lost during his 17-game, late-season big league call up to Baltimore, in which Coby K'd in nearly half of his plate appearances. He is starting to have a more polarized power-over-hit offensive profile, but Mayo is so strong and his swing is so tailored to get to all of his power in games that he should still be an everyday bat. 
Mayo's profile becomes a little dicey if he ends up at a first base-only defender. His size makes it hard for him to move around at third base, and he has been speculatively projected to right field here at FanGraphs since before he was drafted because that's the position that best takes advantage of his plus max-effort arm strength. The Orioles have shown no inclination to try Mayo out there, and began to deploy him at first base semi-frequently starting in 2023; he has played about 20 games there each of the last two seasons. It's not ideal for a hitter whose bat is nearly ready for prime time to still have such an out-of-focus defensive fit. If Mayo can successfully play a more valuable position than first base, it will take pressure off the need for him to resolve his issues with sliders and give him a better chance to be a star-level performer. At first base (where he's now projected, though I'd still love to see a right field trial ASAP), he's more of an average regular."
Kevin Alcantara,CF,CHC,2025,46,50,High,22.7,,,,,"Alcántara's time is nigh, as he enters his final option year in 2025. His looming lack of roster flexibility might force the Cubs, who even after effectively swapping Kyle Tucker in for Cody Bellinger in their outfield, are still flush with big league outfielders at the time of publication, to make a trade that clears room for him to be rostered on Opening Day 2025. That would preserve that final option in the event that Alcántara struggles to find his big league footing and absolutely needs another stretch at Triple-A Iowa to get himself right. This course of events is plausible because Alcántara is still fairly raw and has all the physical markers of a hitter who might require a prolonged adjustment period to actually start hitting. 
At a freaky 6-foot-6, Alcántara's swing is very long and difficult to time. He tends to be late on fastballs and struggles to pull them in the air, but he has plus bat speed and the power to leave the yard to the opposite field even when he isn't on time. He has plus measureable pop at age 22 and he isn't even close to being totally filled out; his frame has room for another 15-20 pounds of muscle before Alcántara's mobility would be threatened by his size. Compounding the hit tool volatility here, however, is Alcántara's tendency to miss secondary pitches, as he doesn't identify or adjust to them all that well and had miss rates north of 40% against sliders and changeups in 2024. Alcántara also drives the ball into the ground a lot; his grounder rate was 50% in 2024, but he still managed to have 35 extra-base hits in 111 minor league games (he missed a few weeks with a shoulder injury) because he hits the ball so hard. Center fielders whose contact profiles resemble Alcántara's include Jose Siri, Michael A. Taylor, James Outman, and Luis Robert Jr., guys whose performance tends to vary a lot year-to-year, and the same will likely be true of Alcántara. 
The thing that stabilizes Alcántara's profile is his center field defense, which has become quite good. He's a plus runner with plus range and ball skills, and he plays with a fearlessness around the warning track. He's gotten very good at the minutiae of the position, like deke'ing baserunners or running to a spot to position himself to throw before he's collected the baseball. With Pete Crow-Armstrong around, Alcántara is more likely to be a potential Gold Glove corner outfielder in Chicago, but here he's evaluated as a center fielder because, league-wide, that's the position at which he has the most value. There's bust risk here, but especially if his ability to lift the ball starts to improve, Alcántara is going to have some All Star-caliber power-hitting seasons and be a very valuable everyday outfielder."
Jac Caglianone,RF,KCR,2026,47,50,High,22.1,40,40,65,40,"The freakishly talented Caglianone presented a serious conundrum to teams picking atop the 2024 draft. He was perhaps as talented and toolsy a college player as there has been in the last decade or so, wielding elite raw power and, for parts of his career, elite fastball velocity, but Caglianone's plate discipline and command were both so lacking that they threatened his entire profile on both sides of the ball. He slugged .738 and hit 33 homers as a sophomore, then slashed .419/.544/.875 with 35 bombs in his draft year, but long levers and poor ball/strike recognition (his chase rates approached 40% in college) caused Cags to whiff quite a bit more than his 8.2% junior year K% might otherwise indicate. His swing, which features a very aggressive hand load way up and away from his body, takes advantage of Caglianone's prodigious athleticism to generate nutty power, but it might benefit from being toned down, not only to help stop Cags from striking out too much, but so that he doesn't drive the ball into the ground so often, which was an issue after the draft. Caglianone looks as impressive in his uniform as anyone in pro baseball (his thighs are practically bursting out of his pants), and he's strong enough to do damage with a simpler operation. These blemishes create risk, but the notion that Caglianone will polish his hit tool and feel for the strike zone once he's been allowed to focus on hitting in pro ball makes him a very exciting prospect.
There's also an exciting fallback option on the mound if strikeouts turn out to be a problem, though that comes with its own risk. Caglianone has an ideal pitcher's frame at a hulking 6-foot-5. He's limber and loose and powers down the mound with ease. His fastball sat 97-100 in 2023, and he has a great changeup. But Caglianone's velocity plummeted in 2024, and he only averaged 92-93 mph from May until the end of the season. His two breaking balls (an upper-80s slider/cutter and a low-80s slurve) are also wildly inconsistent, as is his command and overall feel for pitching. A return to the mound should probably only be explored if Caglianone underwhelms as a hitter for the next couple of seasons. His ceiling as an everyday hitter is big enough that it should be his/Kansas City's focus until it becomes clear that it isn't going to work. This guy has 35 homer upside."
Josue De Paula,LF,LAD,2027,48,50,Med,19.8,40,40,60,45,"For two consecutive years, De Paula has posted an above-average offensive line as a young-for-the-league hitter. He now sports a .291/.411/.420 career line, and his underlying exit velocities are remarkable for a teenager, as they're nearly plus on the big league scale. This is a big, physical, loose-in-the-hips outfielder with enormous raw power projection and an early-career track record of plus plate discipline and closer-to-average contact rates. There are some funky elements to De Paula's swing that have prevented him from tapping into his power in games, and that create some hit tool risk that hasn't yet been exposed. De Paula tends to lose his base as he swings, his mechanics can get handsy (sometimes he still crushes the ball anyway), and he'll spin out even when he isn't swinging all that hard. De Paula is also very vulnerable to righty fastballs running up and away from him. He swings underneath a ton of them, which will become more detrimental to his production as he climbs the minors and faces better heaters. This is a prospect who is still more about projection than present ability on both sides of the ball. De Paula is a tentative corner defender with a great arm that he has not yet tamed. He's talented enough to be valued as a 50 FV prospect because the power-hitting ceiling here is nutty if De Paula and the Dodgers can remedy even a few of his issues."
Kyle Teel,C,CHW,2026,49,50,Low,23.1,45,45,55,40,"Teel, who raked in high school, opted out of the 2020 draft, raked in college, was picked in the middle of the 2023 first round, and has raked so far as a pro. He posted a 145 wRC+ at Double-A Portland in 2024, his first full pro season, and was promoted to Triple-A Worcester in mid-August. It seemed plausible that Teel might debut in Boston in 2025, in part because he has played so well and in part because incumbent catcher Connor Wong has struggled. Instead, Teel became the most well-rounded member of Chicago’s fairly crowded big league/Triple-A catching contingent when he was included in the Garrett Crochet deal.  
Teel does not have the prototypical size and bulk of an everyday catcher; he’s a leaner athlete, and there are times when his lack of strength impacts his receiving and pitch framing at the bottom of the zone. But he does virtually everything else well on defense. He’s a really great ball-blocker and has sensational hands when picking balls in the dirt. Teel’s raw arm strength is average, but he is very accurate even when awkward pitch locations force him to contort his body to throw. 
On offense, his skill set has begun to take on a power-over-hit flavor. He takes a lot of high-effort cuts, and the path of his classic, low-ball lefty swing is geared for lift. Teel has struggled to cover fastballs up and away from him enough that his contact rates have fallen a bit below the major league average at catcher, but his playable power and selectivity (which helps him hunt pitches he can drive) should be enough for him to perform like a good primary backstop."
Josue Briceño,C,DET,2027,50,50,High,20.5,50,50,50,30,"Briceño had a monster 2023 spent mostly on the Lakeland complex, slashing .319/.402/.529 with seven homers. He was among this system's hard-hit leaders at a whopping 42%, one of the few lower-level hitters consistently hitting the ball 95-plus mph that year. He missed most of 2024 due to a strained PCL suffered in mid-May that kept him out until the end of August. He was only able to amass 176 regular season plate appearances and hit .278/.381/.377 (but repeated the 42% hard-hit rate), then Briceño went to the Arizona Fall League and won the League MVP with an absurd .433/.509/.867 line and 10 homers in 25 games. 
Briceño has plus pull power and has now had consecutive years with strikeout rates around 14.5%. His power can be neutered if pitchers execute to the outer third of the zone, but Briceño is capable of going the other way to produce singles and doubles. Briceño didn't catch at all after his knee injury, but he looked pretty good back here before he got hurt, much better than the year before. He does everything fairly well — receiving around the edge of the zone, ball-blocking, throwing — and has improved pretty quickly for such a big, young catcher. He should return to catching in 2025 and projects as an average defender at peak based on his early-2024 look. Another positive development here is Briceño's conditioning. He looked much more lithe and limber in Arizona, and seemed to have cut weight without sacrificing power. Whereas Briceño looked maxed out in 2023, he suddenly has positive physical projection. It's rare for players who miss half the season or more with injury to have also had an overwhelmingly positive year, but that's the case for Briceño, who looks like a future primary catcher."
Rhett Lowder,SP,CIN,2025,51,50,Low,23.1,,,,,"Lowder's performance steadily improved throughout his college career, which ended with a bang. He went 15-0 in 17 starts for Wake Forest prior to the College World Series and posted a sub-1.00 WHIP and sub-2.00 ERA during his draft spring. He was drafted seventh overall as a strike-throwing, quick-moving, three-pitch starter, and in his first full pro season, Lowder was exactly that. He ascended all the way to Cincinnati, where Lowder made six starts at the end of the year. 
A gangly, unspectacular athlete with a theatrical, cross-bodied delivery, Lowder clearly works hard to keep his somewhat awkward frame in great shape. His bow-legged front side, and the stiffness in his hips and lower back, contribute to a funky operation that aids in deception, albeit via an atypical look for a starter. Lowder's stuff isn't overwhelming, but the pieces of his repertoire fit together nicely, and while imprecise, he fills the zone with them. His best pitch is his mid-80s slider, which has considerable length for a breaking ball that hard. The sink/tail action of his fastball limits its bat-missing ability in the strike zone, but its movement pairs nicely with his slider, and it's hard for hitters to cover both sides of the plate when those two pitches are located well in sequence. Lowder's changeup has enough tail and sink to miss the occasional bat, but it more frequently induces groundballs, which is true of his entire repertoire. Lowder is a low-variance fourth starter."
Jacob Wilson,SS,ATH,2025,52,50,Med,23,70,80,35,45,"Wilson was the best bat-to-ball hitter in all of college baseball during both his sophomore and junior seasons. As a soph, he had the lowest strikeout rate among qualified college hitters at a microscopic 2.8%, while as a junior, Wilson only swung and missed a total of 18 times and posted a whopping 10-to-1 ball-in-play-to-whiff ratio. He ended his college career having hit .361/.419/.558 and became the sixth pick in a loaded draft. 
Despite his collegiate success, Wilson was a fairly divisive amateur prospect due to the light, opposite-field nature of much of his contact, as if he were a better-gloved Nick Madrigal sequel. Wilson has allayed some of those concerns in pro ball, as he slashed an incredible .401/.446/.606 combined in the minors across a sample shortened by knee tendonitis. That slugging percentage isn't emblematic of  WIlson's actual power (by a lot), but performance at that level demanded rapid promotion to the big leagues, where Wilson slashed .250/.314/.315 across 103 PA toward the end of 2024 (a season interrupted by a hamstring injury). 
Though their tendencies as hitters are similar, Wilson separates himself from the spectre of Madrigal's lack of impact with much better defense and better long-term physical projection. Wilson has unspectacular range and struggles with hot shots, but his actions are often acrobatic and fun once the ball is in his hands. He is going to make a ton of SportsCenter Top 10s making jump throws to first and crazy feeds to second. 
Since turning pro, Wilson's frame has filled out, especially in his shoulders. He's strong enough to make doubles-oriented contact now, flattening his path to impact pitches at the top of the zone and dipping to scoop low ones, which he often drives the other way. Wilson's inside-out style has him spraying fastballs to right field and pulling mistake breaking balls. He's incredibly aggresive and chase-prone, but his bat control helps him get away with it. Low walk rates are common among players who make high-end rates of contact; guys like Luis Arraez, Madrigal, David Fletcher, Martín Prado, and countless others have had varying degrees of big league success despite not walking very much. What separates Wilson from many players of this ilk is that he's a quality shortstop defender, and he has better long-term athletic projection than many of them because of his lanky build. Erick Aybar and Andrelton Simmons are fair performance comps for what readers should expect from Wilson's arc as a hitter. He should be the Athletics' everyday shortstop from Opening Day 2025 and onward, and while his ceiling is capped by a lack of power and what are likely to be low OBPs, his elite feel for contact should allow him to produce in the 2-3 WAR range."
Cooper Ingle,C,CLE,2027,53,50,Med,23.1,60,60,35,50,"Ingle is one of the twitchier athletes in the minors, with his quickness impacting the game in many different ways. This has been the case for Ingle on offense for a while. He was an excellent contact hitter at Clemson and he's carried that ability seamlessly into pro ball. Of compact build, Ingle can wait forever before he decides whether or not to swing. He's a count-working nightmare who spoils a ton of tough pitches and sprays line drive contact all over the field. In 2024, Ingle slashed .305/.419/.478 at mostly High-A. He walked more than he struck out and kept hitting even after he was promoted to Double-A Akron later in the year. 
The key developments for Ingle in 2024 involved his physique and defense. He has always been on the smaller side of what is typical for a big league catcher, and while that remains true, he has added 15 pounds or so and is noticeably stockier than when he signed. The added strength has made Ingle a much quieter receiver and it hasn't cost him any quickness; he is incredibly agile and it shows in his blocking and the way he exits his crouch. Ingle's arm strength is only fair, so he needs to get rid of the baseball as quickly as possible, and he does. His accuracy can suffer because of his haste, but overall this approach worked for Ingle in 2024, as he's hosed 26% of would-be base stealers and trended better after he was promoted to Akron. It's still fair to wonder how Ingle's body will hold up against the rigors of catching most days at the big league level (he caught 74 games in 2024), but he now has the skills to play the position well, and his combination of contact and on-base ability should be enough for him to clear the offensive bar at his position."
Kevin McGonigle,SS,DET,2026,54,50,Low,20.6,55,60,45,55,"Ranked 19th on the 2023 Draft Board, McGonigle was arguably the high school player from that class with the highest floor because of his middle infield fit and contact ability. McGonigle's stocky build capped his power projection and, theoretically, his ceiling, but his early-career contact performance has been special enough that he might become an impact player, even with modest raw pop. 
McGonigle missed the beginning of the 2024 season due to a hamstring injury and the end of it due to a broken hamate. In between (60 games at Low-A Lakeland and 14 at High-A West Michigan), he slashed a fantastic .309/.401/.452 with more walks than strikeouts and 22 stolen in 24 attempts. His more granular data, albeit in a relatively small sample, was sensational, as McGonigle posted an 88% contact rate and 41% hard-hit rate. There aren't any big league hitters with marks that high in both categories, which, though impressive, is also an indication it's probably not sustainable. Regardless, McGonigle's short levers and terrific barrel feel, especially at the top of the strike zone, is real. He's incredibly hard to beat, even when he expands the zone (which he does much more often with two strikes). McGonigle's hard-hit rate comes more from contact consistency than big raw power. He has below-average raw and, at a maxed-out 5-foot-10, is unlikely to grow into a ton more. But his early count selectivity, and his ability to impact the ball with lift at the top of the zone, should still allow him to get to an okay amount of power for a shortstop. 
McGonigle's hands weren't as crisp in 2024 as usual, but he still has enough arm for short, a well-calibrated internal clock, and great actions around the bag. He's a low-variance everyday middle infielder tracking for a late-2027 debut."
Chase DeLauter,RF,CLE,2025,55,50,Med,23.5,50,50,60,40,"We're in Joel Embiid territory here. DeLauter has not been able to stay on the field since entering pro ball, and he's now had several foot/ankle fractures and sprains dating back to college, some of which have recurred. He has played just 96 regular games since being drafted in 2022, but he has been great when he's been healthy, and is a career .317/.387/.517 hitter who ended his 2024 season at Triple-A. DeLauter's unique swing, in which he alters his footwork as a means of directing his barrel around the zone, often has a weird, truncated finish. This seems to work for him, in part because DeLauter's hands are so strong and able to generate thunderous power without help from big rotational movement. While he's best at golfing low pitches, DeLauter is also capable of taking ones on the outer third deep to the opposite field. His background contact data and lack of chase both reinforce the hitterish scouting look. His injuries have impacted his mobility when healthy such that it's been hard to evaluate his defense; at his size, however, he's absolutely ticketed for a corner. On talent, DeLauter looks like a heart-of-the-order hitter, but his persistent injuries force his FV grade down a shade compared to last year."
Luke Keaschall,CF,MIN,2027,56,50,High,22.6,55,55,50,55,"Keaschall had two solid underclass seasons at the University of San Francisco before he transferred to Arizona State for his draft year, during which he hit an unbelievable .353/.443/.725. He had some first round buzz (probably under slot; the rumor was Boston) and was heavy in the mix of model-driven teams because he was not yet 21 on draft day. Keaschall ended up signing for $1.5 million as a second-round pick. 
The undersized Keaschall is a premium in-the-box athlete with a flexible and powerful lower body, as well as strong wrists that turn over through contact. At Arizona State, he would often look a little out of control, chasing a ton and swinging so hard that he found himself off balance. This is one of the areas in which Keaschall has changed since joining Minnesota's system. His swing rate has dropped from 50% at ASU to 38% with the Twins, and he walked more than he struck out at High-A Cedar Rapids prior to a promotion to Double-A Wichita in late May. He slashed .303/.420/.483 with 15 homers and 21 doubles in 102 games even though he was dealing with nagging right elbow discomfort that ultimately led to a late-2024 Tommy John. Aside from his hard-hit rate, which might very well spike when he returns healthy in 2025, every one of Keaschall's statistical indicators is better than the big league average. Keaschall's swing brings consistent pull-side lift to the party, which means his power production might really pop if a healthy elbow means he can hit the baseball harder. 
Keaschall's best position is ""hitter,"" and his ultimate defensive home still isn't clear. A bad college middle infielder, Keaschall continued to look rough at second base with Cedar Rapids, then he DH'd for most of May because of his elbow, and came out the other side playing more center field and even some first base. His feel for center was predictably pretty rough, but it got a little better as the season went on. Whether Keaschall's elbow issue was part of why he looked so bad at second base, we just won't know until he returns. A number of things could happen here, from ""Keaschall's feel for center field improves"" to ""healthy Keaschall hits for enough power to be a full-time first baseman."" But I'm confident enough in his bat to value him as an everyday player of some kind as he enters his age-22 season."
Marcelo Mayer,SS,BOS,2026,57,50,High,22.3,35,30,55,40,"For a couple of years now, I've written about my apprehension surrounding Mayer's issues with secondary stuff. Throughout his entire career, he has performed in spite of these issues, but they continue to terrify me. Marcelo's front side is so upright throughout his swing that it makes it nearly impossible for him to dip and scoop soft stuff at the bottom of the strike zone and below. He can absolutely button a fastball, but big league pitchers aren't going to show him many of those if he keeps performing like he has against secondaries. Just how stark is the contrast? Mayer had an 87% contact rate against fastballs last year, and a 57% contact rate against breaking balls. It seemed feasible in 2023 that his issues were the result of him playing through injury, but even as he slashed an amazing .307/.370/.480 at Double-A Portland in 2024, this problem lurked beneath the surface and is an unstable Jenga block in the middle of an otherwise exciting profile. Mayer is a powerful mistake hitter with all-fields juice when he gets a pitch in the the middle of the strike zone and above; he had a very impressive 50% hard-hit rate in 2024 and tallied 36 extra-base hits in just 77 games, as Mayer's 2024 season was interrupted for the third straight year by injury. In consecutive years, he has had wrist, shoulder, and back issues, which season Mayer's profile with another element of risk. 
Mayer has always been a bit boxier than the usual elite shortstop prospect, but his hands and actions are so skilled and polished that he seemed likely to play there despite middling range. His footwork and actions are very polished, and the Red Sox have found a way to mask his mediocre range and arm strength (for shortstop) with good positioning. It isn't sexy, but it works. Though Mayer's performance (and my grade for him) has seesawed a bit during his prospect lifetime, he has enough power to be considered a productive, power-hitting shortstop."
Colson Montgomery,SS,CHW,2025,58,50,High,23.1,40,40,55,40,"In 2024, Montgomery had a rough go of things at Triple-A Charlotte, where he slashed .214/.329/.381 and hit 18 homers in 130 games. Though he's never had strikeout issues quite as stark as he showed in 2024, his incredible 2023 looks like a small sample anomaly compared to the rest of his upper-level output. The huge-framed Montgomery still has rare lefty power for an infielder and he has a great idea of the strike zone. His approach is geared to pull as often as he can — it lacks skill and nuance — and he struggles badly to cover the top of the strike zone. 
Especially with the benefit of good positioning, Montgomery does enough to stay at shortstop (he makes plays coming in on the grass very well), but he's a little too slow and clumsy to be considered average there. He should still produce like an good everyday shortstop because of his on-base ability and power relative to others at the position, but he may frustrate in other ways, especially initially. At peak, he could have some seasons with 30 homers and fair shortstop defense, but it almost certainly will not be right away. Montgomery isn't a plug-and-play star who'll be productive on arrival; it will probably take some time."
Kumar Rocker,SP,TEX,2025,59,50,High,25.4,,,,,"In part because of the modern media climate and our collective fixation with The Next Big Thing, Rocker's baseball odyssey has been perhaps the most visible, dramatic and prolonged roller coaster ride any prospect has ever been subject to. He looked like a first rounder for much of his high school career, but his stuff dipped as the 2018 draft approached while his asking price did not, so teams backed away and Rocker went to Vanderbilt. After some rocky early starts his freshman year, something clicked for the right-hander and he was utterly dominant during the second half, culminating in a 19-strikeout no-hitter in a postseason game against Duke. That outing, and Vanderbilt's run to a national title, made Rocker a household name even among casual baseball fans. The pandemic squashed his sophomore season, then Rocker emerged with a noticeably higher release point as a junior. He was fantastic early on, but his fastball lost two ticks as the spring progressed. 
Despite his excellent career performance — 236.2 IP, 321 K, 68 BB, 2.89 ERA — volatility was an inextricable aspect of Rocker's 2021 draft profile, and he fell to the Mets at 10th overall. New York was scared enough of his post-draft physical to squash his deal, which meant Rocker had to wait another year to enter pro ball. He pitched in the independent Frontier League in 2022 and his velocity was back, but again his arm slot had totally changed; this time, it was much lower than when he finished up at Vanderbilt. The Rangers made him a top five pick and sent Rocker to the 2022 Arizona Fall League, where he was scattering 95-97 mph fastballs and had his trademark, plus-plus slider. Then Rocker's elbow blew out in May of 2023 and he had Tommy John, shelving him until July 2024. Upon his return, Rocker was touching 99-100 right out of the gate and again had changed his release, this time to a low-three-quarters slot but a vertical hand position. Over a span of two months, the Rangers gradually stretched him out to the point where he was working five innings, and he made his much deserved big league debut in mid-September. 
Rocker's fastball still lacks great shape, but he lives off of angle and velocity to beat hitters at the letters, and he has an explicit sinker version with more tailing action. Speaking of explicit, Rocker's slider is still X-rated. It sat its usual 84-87 mph last year and generated misses at a 65% clip (the average for big league sliders is 34%), in part because Rocker's command of it is great. Rocker has good feel for locating his 90 mph changeup, and while that pitch isn't especially nasty, he's barely been healthy enough to work on it and it might blossom late. He also has a show-me mid-70s curveball. 
As deliriously happy as we all should be that Rocker has managed to persevere through all of these injuries while being in a white-hot spotlight, his injury history has to factor into the way he's graded here. It's great that he was bumping 100 mph last year, but he did so across just under 50 total innings. I do think his fastball is still vulnerable to big damage even though it's really hard, and he'll be more of a fourth starter on a good Rangers team rather than the club's ace."
Braxton Ashcraft,SP,PIT,2025,60,50,Med,25.5,,,,,"Ashcraft came back from Tommy John with a vengeance in 2023 and earned a 40-man roster spot. He was utterly dominant across his first 50 innings of Double-A to start 2024 and was promoted to Triple-A Indianapolis where, after a couple of starts, he was put on the IL three separate times with recurring forearm issues, the last of which ended his season. He has arrived at 2025 camp with intact velocity, but injuries are an inescapable aspect of Ashcraft's profile due to his history and the violent nature of his delivery. 
When healthy, Ashcraft has good stuff and should be a meaningful contributor to Pittsburgh's pitching staff. His bread-and-butter pitch is his 88 mph slider, which has impressive length and depth for such a hard offering. It generated miss rates north of 40% in 2024, as did Ashcraft's slower, 82-85 mph curveball, which he uses more as a backfoot weapon against lefties. Though his arm angle creates relatively ineffective movement on his fastball, Ashcraft's mid-90s velocity makes up for it somewhat. Similar to Quinn Priester, there might be some issues with Ashcraft's fastball getting hit, or at least he may have to pitch off his breaking stuff more frequently against big league hitters and thus operate less efficiently from a strike-throwing standpoint. He has never had issues throwing strikes in pro ball but also hasn't demonstrated starter-level durability because his career has been interrupted by injuries and the pandemic; his 73 innings in 2024 were comfortably a career high. 
Ashcraft seems likely to be optioned at the start of the 2025 season (he has two options left, while most of the Pirates' projected rotation either does not, or is named Skenes or Jones), but he should graduate at some point this season as he's called upon in response to injury. He has the talent to be a no. 4/5 starter when healthy."
Yoniel Curet,SP,TBR,2025,61,50,High,22.4,,,,,"Curet has led the minors in strikeouts over the last two seasons, with 303 tickets punched in just 223 innings. He's been walk-prone during that time, and his fastball has some round-down elements in its shape and plane, but Curet's delivery is so relaxed and easy that we anticipate he'll continue to polish that as he matures. He's only 22, but for two consecutive years, he's shown he can sustain mid-to-upper-90s velocity across a starter's load of innings. In 2024, his first year on Tampa Bay's 40-man roster, he worked 119 innings, ran a 2.95 ERA and 3.76 FIP, and was still reaching back for 97-98 mph fastballs in September with Double-A Montgomery. 
Curet's fastball generated plus miss in 2024 even though it has suboptimal shape. When he's locating it to the arm-side part of the plate, it has exploding rise/run movement. Curet's slider has plus potential thanks to its rare velocity. It'll touch 90 mph and often acts more like a cutter than a true slider, starting above the zone and bending down into it when it's at its best. Even though it isn't truly switched on as a chase-inducing weapon right now, it has still been able to generate above-average miss. Something as simple as altering Curet's position on the rubber might help it look more enticing to hitters. 
The real late-season development for Curet was his changeup, which he used twice as often in Montgomery as he did in Bowling Green. As you can imagine from a guy who has below-average command and is just starting to use a new pitch, Curet's feel for locating it was inconsistent, but a good number of his changeups have huge tailing action and downward finish. The ease of his delivery makes this pitch very promising; it generated a 60% miss and 45% chase rate in August and September even though Curet had basically only just begun working with it. Curet's fastball, durability (this guy's legs are like tree trunks), and proximity to the big leagues drive a long-term mid-rotation projection. He's entering his second option year and should make his big league debut at some point in 2025."
Jett Williams,CF,NYM,2026,62,50,High,21.4,40,40,50,70,"Williams added significant strength between his junior and senior years of high school, which is how he elevated his stock into the first round of the 2022 draft. He then dominated A-ball in his first full pro season before looking overmatched late in 2023 and early in 2024 at Double-A Binghamton. He was shut down with right wrist soreness in late April with the hope that cortisone and rest would allow him to heal, but instead he needed TFCC debridement surgery and missed four months. He was either out or compromised for too much of 2024 to really glean anything from his performance or underlying data. He went to Arizona for the Fall League, and I thought he looked fine there even though he K'd at a 30% clip. It felt like a season that Jett (and those of us evaluating him) should just flush and move on from. 
Williams still swings with incredible verve and power for a 5-foot-6 guy. His top hand is incredibly strong through contact, giving him power back through the middle of the field. He has historically had issues with high fastballs, and those will likely persist due to the uppercut nature of his swing. Williams' defensive fit is still not clear. I've had him projected to center field because of his speed, and due to the throwing accuracy issues he's had from shortstop, which were present in 2024. Jett split time evenly between center field and shortstop in Arizona, and was running in the 4.1s for me there. He's blazingly fast and should be fine in center with reps. For Williams to be an everyday center fielder would be mold-breaking in a sense; there really aren't players this size who play out there every day. But Jett is already kind of mold-breaking because he's immensely strong for a 5-foot-6 guy, and I think that he'll get to enough power to play out there in an everyday capacity."
JJ Wetherholt,SS,STL,2026,63,50,Low,22.6,50,60,50,50,"Wetherholt is a native of Mars, Pennsylvania, and in college, he hit like he isn't of this planet. He was a career .370/.468/.625 hitter at West Virginia, a unanimous first team All-American as a sophomore and the top ranked player on the FanGraphs Draft Board entering the 2024 season. 
Wetherholt's swing often has huge finish through contact. A big bat wrap gives him a very aggressive angle of attack with the barrel, and feel for oppo contact saves him when he's a little late, which was more common in 2024 (including after the draft), as he was less apt to pull the baseball than in 2023. His in-zone contact rate was in the 90-93% range the last two years of school, and then was 82% in a small A-ball sample after the draft. A thing to watch here in 2025 is whether or not Wetherholt can start pulling the baseball more like he did in 2023. 
Wetherholt suffered a hamstring injury at the start of the 2024 college season and missed about six weeks. On defense, he can be slow to approach balls hit in front of him, and sometimes he struggles to bend and turn around the baseball quickly, hallmarks of a guy with a tight lower body. Wetherholt looked better in this regard once he returned from the hammy issue, but the general flexibility in his lower body is something to monitor. He played a mix of second base, third base, and left field as an underclassman, but was exclusively a shortstop in 2024, and his chances of remaining there are much better than they appeared 12 months ago. Staying at short would give his offense some room to breath if in fact Wetherholt's newfound tendency to inside-out the baseball is a permanent aspect of his profile. He has average everyday shortstop projection."
Tink Hence,SP,STL,2025,64,50,High,22.6,,,,,"Hence was selected in the shortened 2020 draft and was one of the youngest players taken that year. After he was brought along very slowly at the onset of his pro career, Hence maintained mid-90s velocity across 40-inning workload increases in 2022 and 2023 before experiencing a slight downtick early in 2024. He worked 96 frames in 2023, but was handled with such care in 2024 that he only threw 79.2, though Hence was as dominant as he's ever been. 
Tink's changeup took a huge leap forward in 2023, and not only has it become his best pitch, but it's now one of the better changeups in the minor leagues. He'll also flash the occasional plus breaking ball, but not consistently. Hence's fastball wasn't finishing quite as well at the end of 2023 as it was when he looked like a Bryce Miller clone with better secondary stuff. Ideally, he'd continue to get physically stronger for the purposes of durability, an area where I think Hence has plateaued. He still looked very skinny in 2024, and his fastball both missed bats at a shockingly low rate and lost a tick compared to 2023. He's a good on-mound athlete, but he's on the smaller side, and added strength might help him have the stamina to finish his pitches more consistently. Hence has thrown strikes and projects to have a starter-quality mix. He hasn't take the big leap I hoped (on the contrary, there are reasons to be worried about the velo dip), but Tink's secondary stuff is just so good that he should be an effective fourth starter even if that's a consistent issue."
Will Warren,SP,NYY,2025,65,50,Low,25.8,,,,,"Warren yo-yo'd between the bullpen and the rotation at Southeastern Louisiana and went unselected as a true junior in the shortened 2020 draft. He moved into the Lions' rotation in 2021 and had a great season — 91 IP, 95 K, just 98 baserunners allowed — despite sitting mostly 90-91 mph. When play began in 2022, Warren had a new breaking ball and much more velocity, which he has sustained across the last couple of seasons en route to a couple of big league call-ups in 2024. 
Warren had an elevated ERA in 2024, which was his second consecutive season with HR/FB rates twice the major league average. Some of that can be attributed to the hitting environment at Somerset and most of Triple-A, but it is a weird aspect of Warren's sinker-heavy profile. The rest of what Warren brings to the table is stable and fairly exciting. He's a kitchen sink type who can attack hitters in a myriad of ways, all with viable (and sometimes plus) big league stuff. Against righties, Warren uses a sinker/sweeper combination, and will occasionally run his four-seamer up the ladder. Against lefties, he becomes a four-seamer/changeup guy, with the occasional in-zone sweeper as a way of stealing strikes. Warren also has a cutter that, when he locates it, is brutal in on the hands of lefties; he barely busted it out during his half-dozen big league outings. Though his sweeper is easily his nastiest pitch, all of Warren's pitches flash plus. He lacks surgical command, but his ability to get groundballs (his sinker generated them at a 63% clip in 2024) should bail him out of the occasional walk. 
Guys with sinking/tailing stuff like Warren's can tend to be more vulnerable to extra-base damage when they make a mistake, and it's possible I'm underappreciating this aspect of his profile. But despite his 2024 ERA, Warren still looks like an big league-ready fourth starter. He has been remarkably durable and worked at least 120 innings each of the past three seasons, and he has five good pitches and a mature approach to their usage. Warren seems likely to start the season as the Yankees' sixth starter, and is pretty clearly the most talented of the 40-man arms projected to begin the season in Scranton. He's very likely to exhaust rookie eligibility in 2025 and entrench himself in the New York rotation for the next half decade."
Jake Bloss,SP,TOR,2026,66,50,Low,23.8,,,,,"Bloss was taken 99th overall in the 2023 draft out of Georgetown after spending his first three years of collegiate ball at Lafayette College. The Astros promoted him very aggressively; Bloss began the 2024 season at High-A and made his big league debut in June. About a month later, he was traded to Toronto as part of the Yusei Kikuchi deal, and he finished the season at Triple-A Buffalo. Bloss' performance dipped down the stretch and he carried a bloated ERA at Buffalo, but I'm staying on him. Remember, not long ago this guy was facing Patriot League hitters, and now he's staring down Gunnar Henderson. 
Bloss is a high-waisted 6-foot-3 and has incredibly loose, long levers that, along with his big stride down the mound, help him generate nearly seven feet of extension. His fastball only sits 92-95 mph, but it has nearly perfect backspinning ride. Off of that Bloss works with two distinct breaking balls: an upper-70s curveball with great depth and shape that mirrors his fastball, and a mid-80s slider/cutter. The slider has tight, late movement, but lacks chase-inducing length right now. Bloss also has a changeup that, based on the fluidity of his arm action, should mature to average with time, though his curveball's depth gives him a weapon against lefties right now. The rate at which Bloss has developed and, for the most part, succeeded is exciting, and he should entrench himself toward the back of Toronto's rotation at some point in 2025."
Parker Messick,SP,CLE,2026,67,50,Low,24.4,,,,,"Messick, who is third in the minors in strikeouts over the last two seasons, has been a remarkably consistent strike-thrower whose fastball has punched above its weight since he was at Florida State. In 2024, he split the season between High- and Double-A, pitched 133.2 innings, K'd 30.2% of opposing hitters, and posted a 2.83 ERA. Messick's 92 mph fastball doesn't have a ton of carry to it, but it does run uphill and can garner whiffs via its angle. His changeup is at least plus, and the loose, whippy nature of Messick's arm action helps sell it to hitters like a podcaster hawking dietary supplements. Pitchers with plus command and plus changeups tend to overachieve, and the ultra-competitive, sneaky athletic Messick (who has shed a good bit of weight since college) is in that vein. He's tracking like a contender's fourth starter and could be up at some point in 2025, a little bit ahead of his chalk 40-man timeline."
Carter Jensen,C,KCR,2027,68,50,High,21.7,40,40,55,40,"Unpolished defense and hit tool question marks have long been Jensen's prospect bugaboos, and in 2024, he showed signs of improving both enough to be elevated in the Top 100. He was sent back to the Midwest League and slashed a robust .271/.386/.435 with a 15.2% walk rate and 22.1% strikeout rate before he was promoted to Double-A Northwest Arkansas after the All-Star break; Jensen kept slugging, though his peripherals backed up a tad. Then he had a monstrous Arizona Fall League stint during which he slugged .800. 
Jensen's tendency to run deep counts, and the way his swing is geared for power, will probably lead to elevated K's at the big league level, but his contact data has encouragingly hovered around the big league average throughout the last two seasons. He's also patient and has rare juice for a catcher. Jensen's swing is very explosive. He uses an enormous stride that spans nearly the entire batter's box, and his bat path has bloodthirsty lift. At a position where having one good offensive tool is often enough, Jensen should clear the bar thanks to his power and on-base skills. 
Jensen still needs to improve as a defender, but his size and athleticism give him a great shot to do so. His ball-blocking has already gotten much better, but his throwing and receiving both need to quiet down. You can see Jensen's athleticism and flexibility when he throws, but it often takes him too long to get rid of the ball as he thrashes out of his crouch with inconsistent footwork. Jensen's hands are also far too active and noisy as he prepares to receive pitches. These issues are pretty common for catching prospects this age, and are technical problems rather than an indication of a lack of talent. Already a virtual lock to be put on Kansas City's 40-man after the 2025 season, Jensen's big league ETA will be dictated by how quickly he can improve his issues on defense. He seems pretty likely to spend at least most of the next two seasons in the minors and then compete for primary catching duties once Salvador Perez's contract expires."
Joe Mack,C,MIA,2026,69,50,High,22.3,30,30,50,40,"Mack is a lefty-hitting catcher with a big frame, plus bat speed, and a grooved, uppercut swing that helped him hit 24 bombs in 2024, mostly at Double-A Pensacola. Though 'Cola and a couple other Southern League ballparks tend to inflate home runs, Mack has real juice and big league physicality. At times his cut can be a little out of control, and Mack often swings over the top of secondary stuff, but he has rare all-fields power for a catcher and, even at age 22, there is still room for muscle on his frame. Mack has also posted above-average offensive lines at every level except for his 2023 campaign at High-A. Catchers sometimes play through bumps and bruises that impact their offensive production for long periods of time, and it's plausible that was true of Mack in 2023. He's going to swing and miss a ton, both because of how much effort his swing features and because Mack is not a patient hitter, but so long as he's getting to his power, that's fine for a catcher. 
Mack still needs to develop as a ball-blocker. His crouch — an endangered species, as Mack sometimes catches from a traditional crouch rather than on one knee — can be a little high and make it tough for him to get to the ground in time to act as a wild pitch barrier. He is otherwise a good defender with a tremendous arm. Capable of popping sub-1.9, Mack hosed 34% of would-be basestealers in 2024, and as stolen base attempts in the big leagues climb, it helps to have a catcher with a 70 arm. He's entering his 40-man platform year and is on pace to get his feet wet in the big leagues late in 2026."
Cam Smith,3B,HOU,2027,70,50,High,22.1,45,45,60,40,"Smith is an XL third baseman with rare defensive ability for a player his size. Built like an outside linebacker at 6-foot-3 and 225 pounds or so, Smith slashed .331/.420/.594 during his career at Florida State and showed substantial improvement to his strikeout and walk peripherals as a draft-eligible sophomore. The Cubs selected him 14th overall (he was seventh on our Draft Board) and Smith posted strong contact and power numbers after he signed. He slashed .313/.396/.609 in 134 PA, with an 84% zone contact rate (77% overall), 111 mph max exit velo, 107 mph EV90 (the big league average is 104-105), and 43% hard-hit rate. Those are pretty good, and they reinforced Smith's fairly aggressive draft ranking. He was then traded to Houston as part of the Kyle Tucker deal.
Big all-fields power headlines Smith's profile. He's a super strong guy who can generate huge power with little mechanical distance. His swing changed during his sophomore year and he now looks like a more crouched Alec Bohm, with simple footwork, no stride with two strikes, a shallow load, and a bat path that tends to lift the ball less often than is ideal for someone with this kind of juice. Sometimes Smith's lower half is so stagnant that it looks like it's preventing him from getting to pitches on the outer edge; he ends up stuck in the mud and can't reach out there. The same could be said for Smith's swing overall, which detracts somewhat from his athleticism. He's definitely strong enough to hit for power with a simple swing, though he doesn't always look comfortable with the one he's got right now. 
On defense, Smith has rare bend for an athlete his size and at times makes incredible plays for such a big guy. He's not twitchy or fast, but he's remarkably graceful and capable of making accurate throws from all kinds of odd platforms. His hands are inconsistent, and if he keeps growing and getting bigger into his 20s (think age 21 Miguel Sanó, that's where Smith's frame is at right now), he'll possibly lack the mobility to play third base. I'm more bullish about his ability to improve and remain there than the general consensus of amateur scout sources who provided feedback on the 2024 draft prospect list. In fact, I think Smith will be an above-average defender at third despite what will likely be below-average range. He projects as an everyday third baseman, though he might be slower to hit his ceiling than most high college draft picks due to the nature of his swing."
Chayce McDermott,SP,BAL,2025,71,50,High,26.6,,,,,"McDermott was drafted by Houston in 2021 and then was traded to Baltimore as part of the Trey Mancini multi-team swap a couple of deadlines ago. He has tallied more minor league strikeouts than any other pitcher since 2022, with 456 ponchados in 322 innings. In 2024, McDermott struck out a third of opposing batters at Triple-A Norfolk across 100 innings, a total limited by a scapula stress reaction in his right shoulder that cost him all of August. The shoulder injuries are starting to stack for C-Mac, as just a few days before Top 100 publication, he was shut down with a lat/teres strain suffered before Grapefruit League play even began. 
McDermott has impact stuff, and on any given night he'll show you four plus pitches, but his arms-and-legs delivery has proven difficult for him to corral, and he's walked 14% of opposing hitters during the three-year span in which he's led the minors in strikeouts. McDermott has a huge wingspan and creates plus extension down the mound, which helps his heater jump on hitters. It also contributes to the inconsistency of his arm swing and is part of why he sprays his fastball all over the place. He sits 94 with flat angle and ride, and has two nasty breaking balls, a 75-78 mph curveball and an 82-85 mph slider. McDermott is such a loose, whippy athlete that even though he's deep into his mid-20s, I'm still of the mind that starter-level feel for location will come with time. Evidence to that end: His changeup took a big step forward in 2024, and he was busting it out as a right-on-right weapon late in the year. The fact that he's had two shoulder issues in a relatively short period of time is a concerning bummer, but when healthy, McDermott should be a five-and-dive type of mid-rotation starter."
Chandler Simpson,CF,TBR,2025,72,50,Med,24.4,70,70,20,80,"A transfer from UAB to Georgia Tech, Simpson was one of the more fascinating 2022 draft prospects because he had elite speed and bat-to-ball performance in college, but he was also a bad second base defender with bottom-of-the-scale power. Though he is still not hitting for any power, Simpson has had resounding success in pro ball. Every last bit of his superlative contact ability has translated, and Simpson is now a career .326/.394/.375 hitter after having spent most of 2024 at Double-A Montgomery. Now Simpson is quite literally off and running in 2025 big league spring training, and looks like he has a chance to break camp with the big league roster. 
Mid-minors defenses have been the Wile E. Coyote to Simpson's Roadrunner. He is a flat out 80-grade runner who'll clock 3.8 from home to first. When he's legging out a hustle double or going first-to-third, it barely looks like Simpson is touching the ground. This guy has elite, game-changing speed. On top of that, Simpson has posted superlative rates of contact. His slappy approach has held up so far, and he's in the Steven Kwan/Luis Arraez territory in terms of his in-zone and overall contact metrics. Simpson doesn't have the Jedi-level feel for the barrel that those two have, but he tracks pitches very well, he's short to the ball, and he moves the bat around the zone enough to make a ton of contact, even if it isn't always squared up. Aside from the occasional double down the third base line or into the gap, Simpson produces almost no power; his lone pro homer is an inside-the-parker. There is some risk that Simpson ends up producing on offense like Myles Straw or Nick Madrigal, who both also made a ton of contact in the minors. His spray chart looks like a left-handed version of those guys, but the combination of that handedness edge and Simpson’s elite speed gives him a much more threatening offensive dynamic. 
The other key (but still developing) aspect of Simpson's profile is his defense. A bad second base defender as an amateur, Simpson has moved to center field in pro ball. His feel for the position isn't great, and his reads and routes can take him in a couple of different directions even on routine plays. But when Simpson hits the afterburners to go get a ball in the gap, you can see how his speed gives him a shot to be a special defender out there. His range in incredible, and Simpson has just over 140 career games in center field under his belt. There's a chance he develops into a plus center field defender while also being a premium contact hitter with elite speed. Simpson is a unicorn of sorts and should be a special, table-setting offensive player who also plays a premium position well. He's arguably the favorite to lead the league in steals for the next five years or so, and provide rare production for a powerless hitter. "
Yilber Diaz,SP,ARI,2025,73,50,High,24.6,,,,,"Diaz entered 2024 as arguably the best D-backs pitching prospect even though he didn't obviously project as a starter. At the very least, the lightning-armed little righty seemed poised to race to the big leagues on the back of his plus stuff and play a meaningful late-season bullpen role for a contending club. This is largely what happened, but Diaz did a lot to solidify himself as a starting pitching prospect in our minds, mostly because of the way his breaking stuff looks like it will play against lefties. Diaz began 2024 at Double-A Amarillo, but pitched his way to Reno in June and then was called up to Arizona in July. He made four big league starts, went back to Reno for a month, and then returned to Phoenix in a long relief role in September. In total, he worked 132.2 innings across 28 games (23 starts), posting a 3.80 ERA, a 1.29 WHIP, 159 strikeouts and 59 walks. Diaz posted a 12% walk rate prior to his big league debut and then a very reasonable 8.7% the rest of the year. His fastball averaged 96 mph across the whole season and 97 mph when he was deployed in relief. 
Though Diaz's fastball command is spotty, its velocity, shape, and angle give it bat-missing margin for error in the strike zone, and it's reasonable to hope that Diaz's feel for repeating his high-octane delivery will continue to improve as he matures, and that his fastball command will follow. We now know that, even at his size, he's capable of sustaining plus velocity across a lot of innings. His mid-80s slider and low-80s curveball each have vertically oriented movement and bat-missing depth. At times, the curve also has some arm-side action, which should help make it a platoon-neutralizing weapon and allow Diaz to navigate lefties without using a changeup. Ideally, Diaz will find a pitch with cutter-y glove-side movement at some point during his career just to give hitters a different direction to worry about, but what he's working with now plays enough for him to profile as an inefficient, strikeout-heavy no. 4 starter. Over time, Diaz's athleticism should facilitate polish in the areas that most need it and allow him to be a competitive team's mid-rotation guy, the sort who you feel good handing the ball to in a playoff game."
Moises Chace,SP,PHI,2025,74,50,High,21.8,,,,,"Chace has a high-octane arm and checks a bunch of different data and scouting boxes. He has a very athletic drop-and-drive delivery, his arm action breaks the sound barrier, and his heater has exploding life to the eye to go with mid-90s velocity. The data corroborates this: plus extension, low release height, plus vertical movement on his fastball. When Chace is locating his fastball to the belt, hitters have no chance against him. He looks like Bryce Miller did at roughly the same stage, a fastball-heavy 21-year-old of medium build. There is going to be a dominant fastball here, and there are flashes of good secondary stuff that ideally can be polished so Chace can max out, but like Joe Ryan and Miller, when guys have fastballs this good, they tend to pan out. 
Chace's slider flashes late, hitter-freezing, two-plane bend, but it doesn't do so consistently. His changeup has, at times, ridiculous tailing action and can steal strikes running back over the glove-side corner of the plate, but again this is rare. His release is pretty inconsistent generally, which is totally normal for a 21-year-old with this kind of arm speed, but also creates some relief risk. The Phillies could pull the ripcord with this guy whenever they want and put him in the big league bullpen, and he'd probably be really good right away. Building his innings count by 20 frames or so (he threw 80.1 innings in 2024) in his first option year would tee up Chace to work something closer to a viable starter's workload in 2026. Either way, unless his command regresses to 2022-23 levels, Chace's fastball is going to carry him to an important big league role of some kind within the next two to three years."
Brody Hopkins,SP,TBR,2026,75,50,High,23.2,,,,,"Hopkins is a converted outfielder who spent his first couple of collegiate seasons at the College of Charleston, where he didn't pitch very much. It wasn't until he transferred to Winthrop that he began to pitch regularly in a starter role, and he still managed to lead the Eagles in homers during his draft year even though Hopkins was becoming an ""arrow up"" prospect on the mound. A big-framed guy and exciting athlete, Hopkins' stuff took a leap within his first year as a pro, and he quickly became Seattle's best pitching prospect before he was traded to Tampa Bay as part of the Randy Arozarena deal and was promoted to High-A. Across the two orgs he had a strong first full season — 115 IP in 25 starts, 10.41 K/9, 4.15 BB/9, 3.05 ERA — especially for a guy who was still hitting part of the time the prior season. 
Hopkins has a low-slot slinger's delivery akin to Tanner Houck or Camilo Doval. He's a broad-shouldered 6-foot-4, and has a low-slot, drop-and-drive style, with his arm stroke happening suddenly at the very end of his delivery. This wreaks havoc on hitters' timing and creates exploding rise-and-tail life up around the hands of righties. He has been up to 99 and, in his first year of focusing on pitching, threw a decent number of strikes. Obviously, with an arm slot like Hopkins', his slider spells trouble for righties. This pitch has variable movement in the 86-92 mph range. Some of them look like cutters, while others have more length and depth. 
It used to be that pitchers with deliveries like this were rarely found in a rotation, but that's not really true anymore, and it's becoming less true all the time. If Hopkins can develop a changeup and/or a well-commanded cutter, anything to flesh out his repertoire, he has a great chance to be a mid-rotation starter. He checks basically every athletic box on the scout card, and there are all kinds of late bloomer traits here. Pitching full-time is still very new to Hopkins, and the Rays seemed to alter his style of attack after the trade, as he peppered the top of the zone more often. His groundball rate before the deal (59%) and after it (34%) help illustrate the effects of this. This is a very exciting pitching prospect whose floor feels like that of a nasty late-inning reliever. Hopkins has a mid-rotation ceiling if he sustains this velo and finds a third pitch."
Cole Young,SS,SEA,2025,76,50,Low,21.7,60,60,40,50,"Young managed to slash .271/.369/.390 at Double-A Arkansas in 2024 even though it's a pitcher-friendly environment and he was dealing with a nagging wrist issue, which cropped up again in his first and only Fall League game. His underlying exit velos from 2024 are pretty underwhelming, but they're still just shy of the average among big league shortstops (his contact rates are comfortably above) and were probably impacted by his wrist. 
Young does enough on defense to project as a viable shortstop. His hands and exchange are sound, while his arm strength is right on the fringe on what's permissible on the left side. He's performed on offense even as he and the Mariners have made changes to his swing, which now includes a lower load. Young also grinds out tough at-bats. He has great plate discipline, spoils tough two-strike pitches, and tends to put the ball in play even when he chases. If he shows up to camp healthy this spring, there's a chance he grabs hold of the Mariners everyday second base job at some point in 2025. He's a low-variance everyday middle infield prospect who is unlikely to be a star."
Jimmy  Crooks,C,STL,2026,77,50,Med,23.7,45,45,45,20,"Crooks has been a consistently above-average offensive performer at each level since entering pro ball, culminating in a 2024 at Double-A in which he slashed a BABIP-aided .321/.410/.498. His underlying contact and power data is closer to average — 73% contact rate, 104 mph EV90 — though Crooks makes consistently hard contact. His batting stance evokes Luis Gonzalez, and Crooks tends to work the opposite way against pitches that aren't hung breaking balls. It's a solid offensive skill set for a catcher, and Crooks is a very good one. Basestealers should call Crooks ""The Informant,"" as he is not on their side no matter his last name, and while he has above-average arm strength, his accuracy is remarkable. So, too, is his ball-blocking. Crooks' size helps create a flesh wall behind the plate, he ability to backhand balls in the dirt is great, and his strength makes him a good receiver. He's tracking like a glove-first primary catcher with solid average offense."
Juan Brito,2B,CLE,2025,78,50,Med,23.5,55,60,45,50,"Brito was a 2023 Pick to Click who looked too rough around the edges on defense that year to justify putting in last year's Top 100. In 2024, as Brito slashed .256/.365/.443 (.320 xwOBA, per Baseball Savant), his defense improved enough to consider him a viable second base defender. Primarily a middle infielder in Colorado's org before coming to Cleveland as part of the Nolan Jones trade, the Guardians also tried Brito at third base in 2023, and then at a first base and in right field in 2024. It's not as though Brito is suddenly a Gold Glove second baseman, but he's consistent enough to play there in big league games, and he's backed into having uncommon defensive versatility. 
Brito's offensive skill set hovers around average across the board. He has good bat control and some low-ball power from both sides of the plate, though his swing has more consistent lift as a left-handed hitter. Brito hunts fastballs so fastidiously that he tends to chase them, but his bat control allows him to get away with it. Overall, Brito's contact and power metrics are right in line with the big league average among second basemen. He's a platoon-neutral player who can hit from both sides of the dish, and now he's viable at an up-the-middle position, and likely will be at one or two others soon. With Andrés Giménez gone, Brito has a shot to win Cleveland's everyday second base job."
Cade Horton,SP,CHC,2025,79,50,High,23.6,,,,,"Horton was a draft-eligible sophomore who was seen as a ""tip of the iceberg"" prospect, as he missed his freshman year due to TJ and didn't focus solely on pitching until pro ball. It seemed as though things were clicking for him at a different level toward the end of the 2022 college season, and the Cubs were emboldened to select him seventh overall that year. In his 2023 pro debut, Horton posted a .996 WHIP across 88.1 innings, reaching Double-A and sustaining the velocity surge he showed during his breakout junior year despite throwing more innings. That didn't continue in 2024, as Horton's velo backed up and was more in the 92-95 range before he was shut down with a shoulder strain in late May after just nine starts. He missed the rest of the season and was re-examined during the offseason to see if he was ready to begin a throwing program. His status for the start of 2025 is up in the air. 
Horton's delivery is fairly violent and indeed looks tough on his shoulder. Other aspects of his fastball are unexceptional, so it's important for Horton to throw hard for that pitch to be effective. His secondary pitches are what drive his mid-rotation projection here. Horton's slider and changeup both generate plus-plus rates of miss. His slider has rare velocity and two-plane tilt (it's a weapon against both left- and right-handed hitters), and his screwball changeup gives him another way to get lefties out. Horton will probably work inefficiently as a starter unless his peak velocity returns, and will have to pitch off his secondary stuff a ton. He's still likely to be an impact pitcher, but suddenly his list of career arm maladies has grown, forcing Horton toward the back of the overall Top 100."
Troy Melton,SP,DET,2026,80,50,Med,24.3,,,,,"Melton was one of the youngest college prospects in the 2021 draft as well as a plus on-mound athlete, so when he had a really rough season with an ERA just over 6.00, it was easier to swallow a return to San Diego State. In his fourth year as an Aztec, Melton reworked his arm action and climbed into the fourth round of the 2022 draft. 
Melton and the Tigers have continued to make substantial alterations to his stuff, and he has had both bat-missing and strike-throwing success up through Double-A. In 2024, he generated six feet, 10 inches of extension and was sitting 95-97 mph with plus vertical movement from a low release height across 100.2 innings of work. Melton has added roughly five ticks of velocity to his breaking ball since college, and his splinker-style changeup (often mis-classified by automatic pitch tagging) generated plus chase and miss. 
Melton is a strapping 6-foot-4, he throws strikes, and he has two plus pitches and several late-bloomer traits. He was young for his graduating class, was mostly a catcher in high school, missed a season due to the pandemic, and now has a fairly new delivery and breaking ball. He was homer-prone in 2024 (20% HR/FB rate), which is a big part of why he carried an elevated ERA, but that's an unsustainably high rate. Melton was also shut down with a shoulder impingement at the very end of the 2024 season, but he was hitting 98 in a bullpen just before Top 100 publication and seems fine. He's on pace to debut at some point late in 2025 and compete for a more permanent spot in the middle of Detroit's stacked rotation in 2026."
Jefferson Rojas,SS,CHC,2027,81,50,Med,19.9,50,55,50,45,"Rojas hit so well during 2023 extended spring training that the Cubs sent him to Low-A before the complex-level season had barely began. He hit .268/.345/.404 in 70 games there, and the Cubs sent him straight to High-A South Bend when camp broke in 2024. There Rojas slashed .245/.310/.336 as 19-year-old. He has gorgeous hitting hands, great rhythm and timing, and advanced feel for all-fields contact. Though Rojas' granular contact data is very strong (he had a 90% in-zone rate in 2024, for instance, which is great), there are very clearly two ways to get him out: backfoot breaking balls and elevated fastballs. He is very likely to require eventual adjustment to deal with at least one of them. He's still a very exciting offensive prospect, especially for a shortstop, there is just less certainty in this aspect of his prospectdom. 
Rojas has the athleticism, range, and actions to project as a viable shortstop, but he needs polish, as you might expect of a teenage shortstop playing a level above what is typical. Rojas' internal clock is a little slow and he struggles with short hops right now, but the foundation to stay at short is there. He still has an everyday shortstop projection, it's just a riskier version of it than was previously considered here. His medium frame means he's unlikely to develop huge power — this guy doesn't have Elly De La Cruz's ceiling or anything like that — but he has the talent of an average regular via a blend of contact, power and average shortstop defense. Rojas was initially graded as a 45+ FV on the Cubs list, but as the entire player population was considered, it felt more appropriate that end slot in this area on the Top 100."
Arjun Nimmala,SS,TOR,2028,82,50,High,19.5,40,45,60,40,"Nimmala was one of the youngest prospects in the 2023 draft and also one of the most projectable, both because of his big, broad-shouldered frame and because he's new enough to baseball to merit deeper, skill-centric projection. He struggled mightily with breaking ball recognition as an amateur, and at his size, it seemed feasible that he might also need to move off of shortstop. 
In 2024, Nimmala had his ass handed to him during the first several weeks of the season. He was hitting .167 in the middle of May and was demoted to the complex, where his swing was re-worked. It seems to have made a real difference. Nimmala's leg kick and the position of his hands as they load were both altered. When he returned to the Dunedin roster, he hit .265/.331/.564 and stroked 13 bombs in his final 53 games. 
This isn't to say Nimmala is suddenly a lock to be an everyday infielder. He still struck out 29.7% of the time during his hot second half of the season, which is a scary rate at Low-A. His overall contact rate (69%) also wasn't great, but there is at least precedent for power-hitting big leaguers to carry a rate that low and still be impact players. Nimmala already hits the ball very hard. He is a ferocious rotator and is able to generate considerable power because of the strength and quickness of his hitting hands, which are gigantic. Nimmala is able to create big power in a relatively short distance, and his swing isn't overly noisy or hard to maintain. He's also elevating the baseball at an Andy Pages-esque 21 degrees of launch on average, and he's often on time to pull the baseball thanks to a strong top hand through contact. Toward the end of the year, Arjun showed glimpses of being able to cover the outer third and drive the ball to the opposite field gap with power. 
Nimmala is also a terrific bender for his size and has a shot to remain at shortstop. That said, his feel for throwing isn't great, his body doesn't always sequence well from the ground up, and his mechanics can get out of whack. He needs to work on more consistently transferring his weight from one foot to the other, which he badly struggles with on backhand plays. The tools to be an impact power-hitting shortstop are here, and Nimmala will be 19 for basically all of 2025. He was always going to be a slower burn, and now he's shown that he can pretty quickly make relevant adjustments."
Thomas White,SP,MIA,2027,83,50,High,20.5,,,,,"As an underclassman, White was sitting in the low-90s, with a snapdragon breaking ball and a great physical foundation on which to layer velocity. He unleashed even more heat at PG National in 2022 (lots of 93-96 mph) and then shut things down for the bulk of showcase season. Leading up to the 2023 draft, White looked more muscular and mature in the body and held mid-90s velocity throughout the spring, albeit under a very conservative workload. The Marlins gave him just over $4 million as one of two first-round prep arms taken that year, the second straight draft where Miami coaxed a high school pitcher away from Vanderbilt. In 2024, White's first full season, he carried a 2.81 ERA across 21 starts, mostly at High-A. He worked 96 innings and K'd 29.2% of opposing hitters while keeping his walks mostly under control. The strike-throwing aspect of White's 2024 season is the chief reason he moved into the 100, after that had been a concern while he was an amateur. His fastball averaged 95 mph across the entire season, his curveball morphed into more of a sweeper (which helped it play as a back foot weapon against righties), and while White's changeup doesn't have great movement right now, his feel for locating it is pretty good considering he barely had to use it in high school. He's in the early stages of charting a mid-rotation course."
Travis Sykora,SP,WSN,2027,84,50,High,20.9,,,,,"As I noted on last year's Nationals list, you can't help but malaprop Sykora into ""Sequoia,"" because at 6-foot-6 and 230 pounds, Travis is the size of a tree. He overpowered high school hitters with a downhill, upper-90s fastball and promising split changeup as an amateur, and the Nationals gave him $2.6 million in the third round of the 2023 draft. Sykora made 20 excellent Low-A starts during his pro debut in 2024. In 85 innings, he posted a 2.33 ERA, a 1.87 FIP, a 39.2% strikeout rate (yow), and a 8.2% walk rate. 
Sykora has a low-three-quarters arm slot, but his front side stays tall throughout his delivery. It's a funky operation that gives him the option of running a two-seamer down toward his arm-side or elevating his fastball at the belt. Sykora did much more of the latter in 2024 while he held mid-90s velo all year. Even as a high schooler, his fastball command was fairly advanced for a pitcher his size and age, but a 8% walk rate in a 6-foot-6 guy's debut season is even better than one could have hoped for. Sykora's slider, which doesn't spin very much but is aided by its natural downhill trajectory, gives him the means to attack east and west off his fastball, while his splitter combines with the elevated version of Sykora's heater to attack north and south. The direction of the splitter's movement has been all over the place since Sykora was in high school. At times it can look like a slider, and something about its inconsistency plays mind games with hitters. Both of his secondary pitches generated miss rates north of 50% last year. Just before the Top 100 was published, Mike Rizzo told reporters that Sykora will be out until close to the middle of the 2025 season; he had a hip procedure during the offseason and will start the year in extended spring training. It didn't impact his grade here, and so long as Sykora's stuff looks the same when he returns, he'll still have mid-rotation projection."
Felnin Celesten,2B,SEA,2029,85,50,High,19.5,45,45,55,40,"The early portion of Celesten's career has been defined by injury. He suffered a hamstring tear before the 2023 DSL season began, an injury that basically cost him the entire season except for a couple of games in Arizona during Fall Instructional League. Then his season was cut short in 2024 when a slide aggravated a wrist issue that had been bothering Celesten on and off for a while. He had surgery and has now only played in 32 actual games as a pro, though he was also scouted a ton during 2024 extended spring training. In those 32 games, Celesten slashed an amazing .352/.431/.568 and produced a 48% hard-hit rate even though his wrist was hurting. Celesten's physicality stands out immediately and would stand out in a big league clubhouse. He probably weighs 15 or 20 pounds more than when he signed, and every bit of it is muscle; Celesten's shoulders look like he's shoplifting grapefruits up his sleeves. This allows him to make a remarkable amount of hard contact with an easy, low-effort swing. 
Celesten's left-handed swing has a beautifully balanced leg kick that takes advantage of his athleticism without getting out of control. His load from that side is pretty aggressive and deep, with the head of the bat tilted toward the pitcher as he prepares to unwind. You can see in the way Celesten's lower body, hips, and wrists rotate throughout his swing that this is a pretty special and powerful athlete. His swing is currently geared for low-ball contact and he's going to be tested by belt-high fastballs as he machetes deeper into the full-season pitching jungle, but if this guy ever learns how to alter the posture of his body as a means of covering the top of the zone so that his hands can continue to work with their natural loft, he's going to be a problem. His right-handed swing is nowhere near as authoritative and is often late, but you can see the athletic elements of his cut from that side, too. Celesten's swing is not actualized for lift just yet — he averaged just two degrees of launch in a small enough sample that it probably isn't <em>exactly</em> right to say he's a two degree guy, but he hits a ton of grounders, to be sure. 
On defense, I've shifted my forecast for Celesten to second base. He was running in the 4.4s from the right side and the 4.3s from the left for me during the spring (I had no ACL run times from him because his contact quality has been too good for him to ever have to run hard), and I also think Celesten's size at maturity will be bigger than the typical shortstop's. Hopefully Celesten will stay healthy enough to have a full season at Modesto. He's still a risky prospect because he simply hasn't played very much, but his absolute ceiling would give the org something of a Ketel Marte do over."
Tre' Morgan,1B,TBR,2026,86,50,Low,22.7,55,55,40,50,"Morgan was the Eric Hosmer of college baseball for his three years at LSU, playing slick first base defense while bringing a competitive edge and moxy to Baton Rouge. He didn't produce anything close to the typical in-game power output of a big league first baseman, in part because his bat path caused him to drive the ball into the ground fairly often, à la Hosmer. In pro ball, Morgan's swing and approach have changed pretty dramatically a couple of times already, and he has also begun using a bat with a weighted knob. 
During the 2024 regular season, it looked like Morgan was more often taking max-effort swings and selling out for power. He reached Double-A and slugged .483 across three levels, but his middling raw strength and opposite-field tendency as a hitter (plus elevated chase rates relative to his career norms) suggested this was maybe not the best approach for him. In the Fall League, Morgan was more balanced, taking enormous hacks only in favorable counts. He was still stinging the ball in a way that indicates he’ll be a doubles machine, and he seemed less vulnerable to fastballs up and away than he did during the summer. We don't have a way of truly knowing how Morgan will handle elevated big league fastballs until he faces them, but a more balanced, contact-oriented style of hitting is going to give him a much better chance of covering the top of the zone and being a more complete hitter. 
What really tipped Morgan into the Top 100, though, is his defense. He does the splits at first base as easily as you might change the channel from the CBS NFL game to the FOX game during commercials. He is at least the best first base defender Eric has seen in person since young Cody Bellinger, and maybe the best he's ever seen there, period. That said, Morgan looks bad in the outfield and shouldn't play there. Morgan will produce like a second-division regular on offense, but he'll make the whole infield better because of his ability to erase their mistakes on defense."
Starlyn Caba,SS,MIA,2028,87,50,Med,19.3,70,70,30,60,"The primary return from the Phillies in the Jesús Luzardo trade, Caba has a chance to be the best shortstop defender in all of baseball at maturity. He is an unbelievable athlete with ridiculous body control and range, and a big arm for a 5-foot-9 guy. He'll make the occasional overzealous throw that misses first base entirely, but he is otherwise a complete and sensational shortstop. Despite his age, he is basically a lock to be a special defensive player at arguably the most important position on the field. 
Caba has also shown great plate discipline and contact ability in the lower minors. He’s a career .252/.398/.304 hitter across two minor league seasons and spent the last six weeks of 2024 at Low-A Clearwater while he was still just 18 years old. That line is underwhelming more due to the lack of power than anything else. Caba has accumulated many more walks than strikeouts during that span, and his granular contact data (5% swinging strike rate, 93% in-zone contact, 87% overall) is exceptional, especially for such a young switch-hitter. He might not have a huge offensive ceiling, however. Caba is four inches shorter than Zach Neto and his bat speed is only fair. There isn't going to be big power here; in fact, it’s possible Caba’s lack of power will dilute the performance of his on-base and contact skills somewhat — he tends to keep infielders busy. A career similar to that of Jose Iglesias is fair to hope for Caba, while Andrelton Simmons (who had a more meaningful power peak) feels like the absolute ceiling."
Welbyn Francisca,2B,CLE,2029,88,50,High,18.9,60,60,40,60,"Francisca is a compact, switch-hitting bat control prodigy who signed for $1.3 million in 2023. He hit his way from the Goodyear complex to Low-A in 2024 and, combined, slashed .326/.411/.474. He's a fantastic athlete who has rare ball-striking power for an athlete of his size and age, capable of turning on low pitches with power and taking what is given in other parts of the zone. For Francisca to have such advanced barrel feel as such a young switch-hitter is very exciting. 
Limited arm strength and range will likely limit Welbyn to second base over the long haul. He plays defense with a ton of effort, but he too often makes routine plays look spectacular out of necessity. Francisca's swing is explosive enough that, despite being a tad undersized, I think he'll eventually have enough power to profile as a first-division second baseman."
Jedixson Paez,SP,BOS,2026,89,50,Low,21.2,,,,,"Paez is among the most entertaining pitchers in the minors, a whippy-armed lower slot guy with an incredibly fast arm action and great secondary stuff. The undersized, low-three-quarters righty began his pro career as a sinker merchant with precocious command, then in 2024, his secondary pitches and velocity both took a meaningful leap compared to 2023 and Paez retained his incredible command in the process. As a 20-year-old swingman working up to five innings per outing, Paez pitched 96.2 innings and posted a 10.52 K/9, 1.12 BB/9, and 3.17 ERA at (mostly) High-A. 
Paez's athleticism is evident in his delivery and in some of his data. He's a wispy 6-foot-1 but generates six feet,  nine inches of extension because of his enormous hop down the mound. For all of the effort with which Paez throws, he doesn't miss his spot very often. He'll bury his sinker in locations that make it impossible to elevate, run it back over the corner of the plate for a strike, use it to set up his excellent changeup with precise arm-side location, and occasionally run his heater up the ladder, where it can slip past certain hitters' bats because of its angle. Paez's slider, which spins it at 2,700-2,800 rpm on average, was four ticks harder in 2024 than in 2023, and averaged 82 mph. His ability to attack with lateral fastball/slider divergence and then pull the string with his changeup is very advanced. He might also have an uphill cutter at maturity to give hitters one more glove-side pitch to worry about. 
Paez is a great athlete but he doesn't have a great frame. He's smaller than most starters, and he can be slow getting off the mound to field his position, which is a mandatory part of any sinker baller's skill set. But he's also one of the few pitchers in the minors who, statistically and visually, looks like he has a chance to develop elite command. The 2025 season is his 40-man platform year, putting him on pace to get his feet wet at the big league level as a spot starter in 2026."
Edgar Quero,C,CHW,2025,90,50,Low,22,50,50,50,30,"Part of the 2023 Lucas Giolito trade with the Angels, Quero is a switch-hitting bat-first catcher who has had success as a young-for-the-level hitter at each minor league stop, including Triple-A at the end of 2024. He lacks a plus tool, but he's a well-rounded hitter and a viable up-the-middle defender. It’s particularly difficult to sneak one by Quero when he's hitting righty, as his swing is short and flat, which helps him make plus rates of contact from that side of the plate. He has more power as a lefty and is adept at dropping the bat head to make low-ball contact. 
Quero's defense is less mature, and his unexceptional athleticism is evident in this part of his game, which is currently below-average (but not awful) across the board. He has below-average pure arm strength, but has posted a 25% CS% rate (basically average) the last couple of seasons thanks to his accuracy. Keep in mind that while Quero has been around for a bit and has been a fringy defender for much of that time, he's been pushed through the minors aggressively and has been catching upper-level arms at age 20 and 21 the last couple of seasons. 
The presence of Kyle Teel and Korey Lee in the org clouds Quero's future somewhat because he is the worst defender of that group and therefore the one most likely to move off the position. It's possible Lee won't hit enough for this to matter, and that a year or two from now Quero and Teel will be one of the more potent young catching tandems in the league. The White Sox still have at least a year for this stuff to sort itself out before they have to make any kind of actual roster decisions related to this potential logjam. Quero is on track to be added to the 40-man this offseason, while Teel's chalk 40-man timeline is for post-2026, though his promotion pace has tracked ahead of that. Though he probably won't be a star, Quero is a well-rounded young hitter who should hit enough to be in the lineup every day, even if half the time he's a first baseman or DH."
Edgardo Henriquez,SIRP,LAD,2025,91,50,High,22.8,,,,,"If you're looking for a Mason Miller character in this year's prospect crop, Henriquez is probably your guy. He's an ideally built 22-year-old who throws 100, it's just that Henriquez's body and arm are too explosive for him to control right now. He missed 2023 recovering from TJ and was put in the bullpen after just five Low-A starts early in 2024. He raced through the minors as a reliever and debuted in late September, but he struggled with walks (just shy of 13% on the year). 
At some point things are going to click for Henriquez and he's going to be a dominant closer. He touched 102 last season and sat 98-99. Automatic pitch tagging thinks Henriquez's slider is a cutter, in part because it's so hard (it'll touch 94) and in part because Henriquez doesn't locate it to his glove side consistently enough for it to have long, slider-y movement. When he does snap off a good one, it has incredible two-plane movement and depth for a pitch traveling nearly 90 mph most of the time. Days after the Dodgers' World Series parade, Henriquez was bundled up at an Arizona Fall League game, just to hang out and watch baseball. I like that. He's immensely talented, he's been to The Show already, and it wouldn't surprise me if he's the Dodgers' best reliever at some point in the next year or two, and then beyond."
Tai Peete,CF,SEA,2028,92,50,High,19.6,40,40,60,55,"Peete was a 2024 Pick to Click who has clicked for an unexpected reason: It looks like he's going to make a successful transition to center field. A high school shortstop whose size likely would have been a prohibitive long-term factor at that position, Peete was error-prone at short in 2024 and, in the middle of the season, the Mariners shifted him to the outfield on a part-time basis. It's not as if Peete instantly became Kevin Kiermaier out there, but his first step and range were surprisingly good. Like Lourdes Gurriel Jr., Peete has taken some of his infielder skills out there with him, and his exchange on throws is uncommonly quick. Unsurprisingly, his routes need some polish, but Peete boldly made some spectacular plays out there last season. He's already better in the outfield than he is at short, where errors of all sorts were common for him in 2024. Part of me wants Peete to keep playing some infield, if only so that he keeps having opportunities to handle the baseball as much as possible as a way of improving his hands, but part of me wants to see the Mariners commit to the center field thing full-time. 
Of course, the reason I thought Peete would break out in 2024 is because of his immense, frame-driven power potential. He has an ideal baseball player's build at a broad-shouldered 6-foot-2, and he put on an absolute show during BP at the 2023 Combine. He came to pro ball with hit tool risk, and that still exists. He posted a 67% contact rate in 2024 and still struggles to cover the outer third of the zone because of how early his front side drifts open. But despite Peete's lever length, he's often on time to pull. It's kind of amazing how often he's able to snatch pitches riding in on his hands, and he showed glimpses last year of being able to bend at the waist so that he can cover that outer edge with power. He's still growing into his body and should add more raw juice as he matures. He made the 100 more on upside than certainly, as he has a shot to be a 25-homer center fielder."
George Klassen,SP,LAA,2025,93,50,High,23.2,,,,,"Klassen developed from a hard-throwing sideshow into a high-upside mid-minors starter in about a year under the Phillies' tutelage, then was traded to the Angels as part of the Carlos Estévez deal. He walked nearly a batter per inning in his draft year at Minnesota, but coasted through A-ball with fewer free passes in his first pro season. Klassen had a sub-1.00 WHIP when he was traded to Anaheim, and improved his control while also adding a cutter and polishing his curveball. Still, his walk rate exploded after the Angels acquired him, and chances are that he is going to be a reliever in the end. 
Klassen is a super whippy and bouncy athlete who generates huge arm speed. His delivery requires a ton of effort and violence to produce upper-90s heat, and he throws a lot of non-competitive pitches. But improving his breaking stuff (his power curveball is now comfortably plus) and adding a third pitch (his 90-92 mph cutter probably eventually will be, too) is a huge one-year leap for Klassen to have made when there were times in his draft spring when he looked absolutely awful. Klassen has mid-rotation upside if he can hone his command and is a late-inning relief fit if he can't. His rapid progression in this area is encouraging and, even if it doesn't continue, he's going to be an impact arm of some kind. It's fine to value him toward the back of the Top 100."
Grant Taylor,SP,CHW,2026,94,50,Low,22.9,,,,,"Some readers might recall that the fall prior to their draft year, it was Taylor who was slated to be LSU’s Friday night guy the following spring, while Paul Skenes, fresh from the transfer portal, was the team’s presumptive number two. A draft-eligible sophomore, Taylor blew out and needed Tommy John right before the start of the 2023 collegiate season and, as a result of his injury and a meager statistical track record that included just one walk-prone season, he fell to the second round of that year’s draft. 
Taylor was only able to squeeze in 19.1 innings during the 2024 regular season once he was finished rehabbing, and came to the Arizona Fall League to pick up reps. At times he looked great there, flashing four average or better pitches, including a plus-flashing changeup that wasn't part of Taylor’s college repertoire at all. Taylor sat 96-98 range early in outings and 94-98 overall. His fastball has vertical shape and plus ride, which pairs nicely with the shape of a 83-ish mph curveball that has fair depth but often lacks bite. Taylor’s 84-90 mph slider and 87-89 mph changeup are his two nastier secondary pitches. Breaking ball consistency will be key for Taylor moving forward. His slider’s finish is inconsistent, but when it’s right, it’s plus at that velocity. His changeup is going to give him a weapon to neutralize lefties that’s better than his curveball; the bottom falls out of it just as it reaches the plate, but again, it's a brand new piece of Taylor's repertoire. Much of Taylor's profile is risky. For one, we don't know whether he'll be able to sustain plus velocity across a starter's workload yet. But he has the makings of at least three plus pitches and the ceiling of mid-rotation starter."
Carson Whisenhunt,SP,SFG,2025,95,50,Med,24.4,,,,,"What kind of role can Whisenhunt's all-world changeup carry him to if the rest of his skill set is just okay? Though Whisenhunt has improved in a few key areas, his strike-throwing is still on the fringe of what tends to be viable for a big league starter. His walk rate improved quite a bit in the second half of 2024 (from 12.3% to 9.8%) but was still worse than all but eight major league starters who worked at least 120 innings last year. 
There are other encouraging signs here, though. Whisenhunt held his usual velocity all year even though he exceeded the 100-inning threshold for the first time. He had previously only peaked around 60 innings, first as a college sophomore and then again in an injury-shortened 2023. Whisenhunt's breaking ball, which was once a flaccid curveball, is now a serviceable 82-85 mph slider. Most importantly, he has an elite pitch. His changeup is good in any count — hitters can know it's coming and still be fooled by it. It has generated elite miss rates for multiple seasons, including against Triple-A hitters in 2024. A Devin Williams type of outcome would be plausible for Whisenhunt should he prove unable to start. He stands a good shot to debut late in 2025 and compete for an Opening Day roster spot in 2026."
Luis Morales,SP,ATH,2027,96,50,High,22.5,,,,,"The A's frequently have late-market bonus pool space left to target Asian and Cuban players in the international amateur space, and that enabled them to sign Morales, who they inked for a whopping $3 million. Morales began his A's career in the DSL, but he was so dominant that he was sent to Arizona after just four outings and ended the 2023 season at High-A Lansing having pitched across four different levels. Morales began 2024 in extended spring training with a shoulder impingement before he was sent out at the very end of April. He ended up working 81 innings across 22 starts at High-A Lansing and posted a 4.22 ERA, 24.9% strikeout rate, and 10.7% walk rate. Morales continues to look like an absolutely electric athlete with all-world arm speed, but he's still more a thrower than pitcher. 
The raw material Morales brings to the table is exceptional. He has an ideal pitcher's frame: a broad-shouldered 6-foot-3, tapered at the waist, with oodles of physical projection, like a young Zack Wheeler. His arm speed looks like it should break the sound barrier and produces easy, upper-90s cheese. Morales also has a hellacious two-plane curveball in the 81-84 mph range, and you can go wild projecting on his changeup because of his athleticism and arm speed. 
But Morales' pitchability and on-mound poise need to improve. He works at a breakneck pace that often feels counter productive. He gets the sign from his catcher and lets it rip; he doesn't seem to be executing any kind of plan or competent sequencing, and his command is pretty scattered. Morales and the A's have plenty of time to develop his feel for these things, as his 40-man timeline doesn't start until after the 2026 season. 
Morales has this grade and a reservation on the Top 100 ranking because of his upside, which is considerable. He looks and moves like a top-of-the-rotation starter, and his stuff gives him a late-inning relief floor if he only barely develops as a strike-thrower. Were he a college prospect, Morales would be a top five pick (give or take) in most drafts because of his raw ability. Oakland's track record of optimizing pitchers isn't the best, but scouting and predicting aren't the same thing. Morales isn't racing to the big leagues and is definitely more of a Las Vegas A's prospect than a Sacramento A's prospect, one who will probably spend most of the next couple of years trying to grow and improve as a craftsman. He has a shot to become an All-Star starter down the road."
Noble Meyer,SP,MIA,2027,97,50,High,20.2,,,,,"Ah yes, high school pitchers. Aren't they fun? Meyer hasn't had anything close to his peak high school velocity so far in pro ball, as he sat mostly in the low-90s throughout the 2024 season and struggled badly with walks. Despite this, he was still really hard to hit, and he surrendered just 42 knocks in his 74 innings. I'd argue it's encouraging that even though Meyer's velocity was down from its mid-to-upper-90s peak, nobody could touch his stuff when it was in the zone. Meyer checks nearly every scouting and analytical box. His 6-foot-5 frame is lanky and projectable, his arm works loose and free, he has a lower-than-average release height, and he can create huge action on his secondary pitches. All of these things were still true of Meyer in 2024. His slider and changeup still flashed plus, and he presents a very exciting physical package. Obviously, how Meyer looks in his second full season will be important, but for now, I think it's fair to chalk up his 2024 to the grind and rigors of a pro season, which are simply much different than what the young man experienced in high school."
Xavier Isaac,1B,TBR,2026,98,50,High,21.3,30,20,70,40,"Isaac has some of the most exciting power in pro baseball. A formerly pudgy high school first baseman, Isaac completely reshaped his body, and in a 2023 season spent mostly at Low-A, he became one of the more exciting power-hitting prospects in the sport, as he slugged .521, posted elite peak exit velocities, and struck out at a very reasonable 21.2% clip as a 19-year-old. Isaac had some underlying swing-and-miss issues (a 68% contact rate, lower than all but a couple of big league first basemen), but the guys who succeed in spite of this (the Bryce Harper, Brent Rooker, Kyle Schwarber types) all do so with gargantuan power, which Isaac has. 
Isaac broke camp with the High-A Bowling Green squad in 2024, and was running a 69% contact rate through May before he completely collapsed. By the end of the season, he had a sub-60% contact rate, which is not viable at the big league level. Isaac was getting absolutely worked by pitches in on his hands. His swing is just too long for him to get the bat to that location, and this issue will only get worse as Isaac faces upper-level pitchers who throw harder. There has to be intervention and adjustment here to get Isaac to shorten up, or he won't hit enough to be a big leaguer. His raw power, however, is elite. This is a 21-year-old with 40-homer power who has already made one significant change (his conditioning) as a pro. If Isaac — who has other hitterish elements in his ability to make in-flight adjustments to breaking balls and power fastballs away from him to left field — can get back to being a nearly 70% contact hitter, he's going to be a monster. Even if he can just get into the 65%-ish area, he'll be able to have a Chris Carter-type career. This grade is more about valuing Isaac's ceiling than it is a representation of his current skills. He's Schrödinger's Cleanup Hitter whose early-2025 mechanical look is very important to monitor."
Jeferson Quero,C,MIL,2025,99,50,High,22.5,40,55,55,40,"Quero suffered a torn right labrum diving back to first base in the very first game of the 2024 minor league season and missed the whole year. He was coming off a 2023 spent at Double-A Biloxi during which he slashed .262/.339/.440, doubled his career home run total with 16 bombs, upped his previously concerning walk rate to 10%, and earned a 40-man roster spot. The labrum issue puts Quero's impact arm strength at risk, and we won't know that it's still there until we see him throw again in 2025. He has an ultra-short arm action and was often popping around 1.80 at the end of 2023. The other aspects of Quero's defense need work. He often gets caught in between wanting to block or backhand pitches in the dirt to his right, and Quero is a fairly noisy pitch framer, but overall he's much more advanced than most catchers his age and he probably would have been fine had the Brewers needed him at some point in 2024. 
Quero has a power-over-hit offensive profile and will take some hellacious and wild swings. He gets right on top of the plate and is looking to pull. This approach can leave him vulnerable to stuff on the outer edge, which he sometimes struggles to reach, but so far it has worked for him; Quero has never struck out more than 19% of the time at any minor league level. His contact merics from 2023 — an 85% in-zone contact rate, 75% contact overall — would rank near the middle of the primary catching pack across the last couple of seasons, but Quero is still pretty chase-prone. Even with the uptick in walks in 2023, his swing rates (56-57% the last few seasons) have been way up there with the Mario Felicianos, Francisco Mejías and Jorge Alfaros of the world, predecessors whose monster tools have been severely undercut by their voracious approaches. Yainer Diaz had a rock solid 2022 debut with similar rate stats, and Quero is a better defender than him or Mejía (identical rate contact stats), so his floor should be higher. A big part of Quero's above-average projection comes from his game-changing arm strength, a key component to understand the second he's catching in games again."
Jonny Farmelo,CF,SEA,2028,100,50,High,20.6,45,40,55,70,"Farmelo had the second-fastest 30-yard dash at the 2023 Draft Combine and showed impressive BP power, but his swing was a bit of a mess and seemed to change constantly throughout his high school career. I was relatively low on him prior to the draft, but the Mariners made his swing better pretty quickly after he signed. He still has a lot of extraneous movement in his hands, but Farmelo looked good during backfield activity and then during Modesto's 2023 postseason run. Assigned to Modesto again in 2024, Farmelo was slashing .264/.398/.421 across 221 plate appearances when he blew his ACL while making a slightly awkward catch in the outfield. A typical ACL rehab puts him on the shelf until the middle of the 2025 season. 
It's a developmental blow to a prospect who is much more talented than he is polished. Farmelo can create big power in a short mechanical distance at the dish and he has pretty good bat control, but he still has a bunch of pre-swing movement in his hands that impacts the consistency of both. It's hugely positive that despite this, Farmelo was consistently pulling the ball with power before he got hurt, including fastballs. That's not often the case with hitters this size or who have funky swings. Farmelo has the footspeed to play center field and makes some incredible plays deep in the gap, but he's very raw from a procedural and fundamentals standpoint, things like fielding the ball on the ground and where/how hard to throw the baseball. Farmelo has enormous ceiling as a power/speed center fielder if he can season his defensive ability, and the ACL tear robbed him of reps. 
Farmelo has a big, physical 6-foot-2 frame. His speed is great on its own, but it's absolutely incredible how fast Farmelo is for his size. Whether that's still true on the other side of the ACL tear is also going to have a huge impact on his potential outcomes. This is a rare player who looked like he might have actual five-tool potential, but unfortunately, what was an already risky profile has now seen that risk heightened by severe injury."
River Ryan,SP,LAD,2026,101,50,Med,26.6,,,,,"Ryan was a two-way player at UNC Pembroke and one of the more exciting pitchers on the Padres backfields during their 2021 instructs period, when he hadn't yet pitched in an affiliated game. A plus on-mound athlete with a great arm action and a carrying fastball that was in the 93-95 mph range, he was an exciting, tip-of-the-iceberg dev project for a Padres org that had had recent success with two-way and conversion arms, most prominently Luis Patiño. Then the Dodgers plucked him away in a trade for corner role player Matt Beaty in late March of 2022, and we started to see parts of the iceberg that lay beneath the surface during Ryan's first full season as a pro pitcher. He was more in the 95-97 mph range throughout 2022 and was dominant (if a little wild) across just shy of 50 total innings. In 2023, Ryan held mid-to-upper-90s fastball velo under the stress of twice as many innings. He posted a 3.33 ERA in 97.1 innings with Double-A Tulsa. Shoulder fatigue shelved him for most of the first half of 2024, and though he looked totally fine upon his initial return and made his big league debut at the end of July, he blew out at the end of the season and had Tommy John in August. It will keep him out for the entire 2025 season.
In addition to the plus velocity, healthy Ryan has three plus-flashing breaking balls in a mid-90s cutter, an upper-80s slider, and a mid-80s curveball with late vertical bite. Ideally Ryan will be able to refine his changeup over time; he was using it less than 10% of the time when he blew out, often in even counts. Its results weren't great, but he's a great athlete who is relatively new to pitching, so you can project on that offering. His curveball has enough depth to act as his go-to bat-missing weapon against lefties until his changeup improves. 
The visual report here is pretty ironclad. Ryan's build is a little bit more slight than the prototypical big league starter, but at 6-foot-2, he isn't small. He has sustained premium velocity over 100 innings of work, his breaking balls are plus to the eye and grade out as plus on paper, and while his command isn't great, it's sufficient for Ryan to start and might continue to improve as he gets experience pitching. Ryan was a 55 FV pitcher and looked like one of the better all-around pitcher prospects in baseball before his unfortunately timed TJ added volatility and a prolonged waiting period to his profile."
Ricky Tiedemann,SP,TOR,2026,102,50,High,22.6,,,,,"Tiedemann had a breakout 2022 pro debut during which he climbed all the way to Double-A and, across just shy of 80 innings, struck out 38.9% of hitters and walked just 9.6%. In 2023, vague arm soreness impacted his workload, and then in 2024, Tiedemann was shelved with a shoulder injury early and blew out his UCL not long after returning from the shoulder issue. He had TJ in late July, putting him on track to miss most or all of 2025. 
When he has been healthy, Tiedemann’s stuff has been excellent. He relies heavily on a wicked, mid-to-high-90s four-seamer thrown from a deceptively low lefty arm slot that seems to make hitters in either batter's box uncomfortable. He pairs it with a huge sweeper that has a boatload of horizontal movement, so much in fact that at times it's easy for hitters to lay off of it. Still, it's a great strike-getting weapon because it starts in the lefty batter's box and finishes on the arm-side corner of the plate. Tiedemann's changeup is also pretty good, though more because his command of it has progressed; on pure stuff, it's only fair. He already has two plus pitches and one that pretty comfortably projects to be above average, and even while dealing with arm discomfort in 2023 and 2024, he was able to strike out well over a third of opposing hitters. Aspects of Tiedemann's delivery are unique in a way that makes him look reliever-y, and repeated years of arm trouble add to that risk, but even if he ends up in the bullpen, he's going to be such a dominant reliever that he'll still belong about this high on a prospect list. The 2025 season is Tiedemann's 40-man platform year, and it will be interesting to see whether the Jays deploy him in the AFL or instructs as a means of determining whether or not to roster him, though doing so would expose him to the eyes of rival scouts who might be foaming at the mouth to pop him in the Rule 5 and see what happens."
Kevin Alvarez,1B/LF,HOU,2031,,45+,High,17.2,45,50,60,40,"A 6-foot-4 Cuban outfielder with very exciting left-handed power projection, Alvarez has a big, prototypical corner outfield frame in the Nick Castellanos mold. His hands work with natural loft; he has a traditional low-ball lefty scoop. His lever length creates some hit tool risk, but Alvarez might be able to shorten up as he gets stronger. He's fast enough at time of signing to try center field in pro ball, but realistically (and perhaps ideally) Alvarez will be too big at maturity to play there. A below-average arm limits him to left field if that's the case, but the raw power to clear the bar at that position is going to be here. Potential three- or four-hole hitter with 25-plus bombs."
Braden Montgomery,RF,CHW,2027,,45+,High,22,40,35,60,50,"Montgomery was the 12th pick in the 2024 draft and probably would have gone higher if he hadn't fractured his right ankle sliding into home during the 2024 collegiate postseason. Selected by the Red Sox, he was traded to the Pale Hose as part of the Garrett Crochet swap. Montgomery comes from a family with multiple Division-I athletes and was among the most prominent of the 2021 high schoolers to go to college rather than sign. He spent two seasons at Stanford, where he played both ways and showed meaningful bat-to-ball improvement as a sophomore after a strikeout-prone freshman year. He transferred to Texas A&M for his draft year and was the most talented player on the College World Series runner-up squad. Montgomery slashed .317/.428/.646 throughout his entire college career, with a 20% K% as a junior. 
A super physical 6-foot-2 switch-hitter, Montgomery has monster bat speed from the left side. He has a crouched leg kick, his hands load at a conservative depth, and his hips absolutely explode though contact and help ignite his awesome hack, which has big finish in the dirt behind him. Montgomery’s lefty swing generates power to all fields, and he has some ability to alter his upper body’s posture during his swing in order to clear out the top of the zone, something that he only seemed to develop during his time at A&M. His righty swing is more generic; he has a low-ball tendency from that side and his cut isn’t especially dynamic. He’s vulnerable to changeups as a lefty, and up-and-away fastballs and back-foot breakers as a righty.
Montgomery has a huge arm in right field. He was up to 97 mph as a freshman reliever — his stuff was down during his sophomore year at Stanford and he didn't really pitch at A&M — and, at least before his ankle injury, he had the speed to give center field a try in pro ball. Some of the changes he made at A&M improved the strikeout issues that were once caused by his lever length. This is a switch-hitter who was also a two-way player until 2023, and his performance is even more exciting given that context. Above-average plate discipline and a swing geared to get to his power will help Montgomery overcome what are likely to be elevated strikeout totals. He has the ceiling of a power-hitting right field cleanup batter, but he'll probably be a relatively slow developmental burn for a college player. If the impact of his swing tweaks and speed (and what that does for his potential defensive fit) appear intact upon return, he'll move into the Top 100."
Elian Pena,3B,NYM,2031,,45+,High,17.4,,,,,"Peña is likely to receive the top bonus in the 2025 international class at $5 million, a deal that has been in place since well before David Stearns began to helm the org. Peña has real feel to hit and power despite a relatively squat frame at a stocky 5-foot-11 or so. He has thunderous hands, authoritative to all fields. Peña's swing has big time natural uppercut — at times it has an abbreviated finish, at times it finishes in the dirt behind him a la Ken Griffey Jr. — and it's going to allow him to get to big time in-game power. He has a great chance to have an impact hit/power combination. Peña's a below-average runner and athlete who plays defense with a high center of gravity; he's more of a possible third base fit with first base possibility. A mature build and feel to hit create the possibility that Peña moves quickly through pro ball. He has the talent to be a middle-of-the-order force."
Matt Wilkinson,SP,CLE,2026,,45+,Med,22.3,,,,,"Nicknamed ""Tugboat,"" Wilkinson is a 270-pound lefty who is incredibly athletic for an athlete of his build. His drop-and-drive delivery gets him so low to the ground that his left shin is almost scraping across the top of the mound. His fastball only sits about 90 mph, but it still played like a dominant pitch in 2024 because of its rising action and Wilkinson's ability to command it to effective locations. His sweeper gives him a second above-average offering, while Wilkinson's changeup is still a work in progress. Feasting off his fastball, he was able to strike out 37.6% of opposing hitters in 2024; Wilkinson worked 118.2 innings and allowed just 71 hits. If his changeup takes a step forward, or if Wilkinson starts throwing harder and ends up with an elite fastball, he'll project as a convention-breaking mid-rotation starter."
Cristopher Polanco,SS,TOR,2031,,45,Med,17.2,60,60,40,60,"Polanco is a low-to-the-ground defender with plus feet, hands and actions. His arm strength the lone question on defense; Polanco is otherwise among the best infield defenders in the 2025 international class. He has a smaller frame but is muscular and strong for his size. Polanco's twitchy, and his hands are often in the right place at the right time in the batter's box. A compact athlete with a compact swing, he covers the inner half well. There's a chance for a plus hit tool and shortstop defense here, with Polanco's power likely below average at maturity due to his lack of size."
Yorger Bautista,CF,SEA,2031,,45,High,17.5,60,60,45,60,"Scouts generally like Bautista more than his raw bonus would indicate. He's a twitchy, medium-framed outfielder with explosive hitting hands and wrists, and a swing that has natural loft. Bautista's hit tool is consistently lauded. He has a shot to remain in center field thanks to his speed, though it might depend on how he develops physically. Bautista is a well-rounded center field prospect with a shot to do at least a little bit of everything and be an everyday player."
Matt Koperniak,LF,STL,2025,,45,Med,27.1,45,55,50,55,"Cardinals Devil Magic has returned. Koperniak was about to start his senior season for the Division-III Trinity Bantums when the pandemic hit. Instead he signed as an undrafted free agent and, like a lot of Cardinals batting-gloveless prospects who slip under the radar for a while, he was initially very old for his level but then raced to Double-A. Koperniak has spent the better part of the last two seasons at Triple-A Memphis and he had a power spike in 2024, both in his on-field performance (a career-high 20 homers and 28 doubles) and exit velocities (101 90% average in 2023, 104 in 2024). Koperniak rotates very hard and his best swings are impressively explosive. He has classic low-ball lefty power to his pull side, but for the most part Koperniak does his extra-base damage to the opposite field. Elevated chase rates detract from an otherwise well-rounded offensive profile, enough for Koperniak to be the larger half of a corner outfield platoon."
Austin Peterson,SP,CLE,2026,,45,Low,25.5,,,,,"A 6-foot-6 strike-throwing Leviathan, Peterson has the lowest walk rate (4.3%) among qualified minor league starters since 2022. In 2024 (half at High-A and half at Double-A), Peterson made 27 starts, worked 160 innings, and carried a 2.64 ERA. He generates plus vertical movement on a 90 mph fastball and peppers the top of the zone with that and a couple of different breaking balls. The Guardians have been able to take older, strike-throwing starters and help them throw harder past when one might expect pitchers to start doing that, with Tanner Bibee a prominent recent example. Peterson's size and bodily fluidity make it seem feasible that this could happen for him, but for right now, his stuff lacks the power of a mid-rotation starter, and he's more of an innings-eating no. 4/5."
Andrew Salas,SS,MIA,2031,,45,High,17.1,50,50,45,60,"Salas been among the top players in the 2025 international class for a while, in part because of his siblings (Ethan and Jose), domestic showcase activity, and his family's heavily-scouted baseball training facility. Andrew is a talented, projectable shortstop with a shot to be plus defender. He has experience at shortstop and in center field, including summer 2024 pro ball in Venezuela. He comfortably has the range, actions, and arm to stay at shortstop, and is great around the bag himself and at feeding teammates. On offense, Salas' low-ball swing produces gap-to-gap contact. He might struggle with high fastballs the way Jose did once he got into the mid-minors. Salas has a projectable build; he's 6-foot-3 with broad, sloping shoulders. He should grow into above-average power, but whether his swing is geared to tap into it is another matter. Salas is a potential everyday shortstop whose bonus is likely to approach $4 million."
Alan Roden,LF,TOR,2027,,45,Med,25.3,60,65,45,40,"Roden has posted god-tier surface-level stats dating back to college, and he's done so in pro ball while making several significant mechanical adjustments to his swing. In 2023, he was given Craig Counsell's batting stance and a big leg kick, while his hands were lowered closer to his ear in 2024. The changes have helped Roden, who turned 25 in December, to access more power without trading off much contact. He slashed .293/.391/.475 split between Double- and Triple-A in 2024, running a 93% in-zone contact rate and 83% overall. His measureable power (37% hard-hit rate, 103 mph EV90) was a shade south of the overall big league average, but comfortably below what is typical for a corner outfielder. The short-levered Roden is best at accessing his power against breaking  balls that finish middle-in. It's against these pitches you can really see how much his swing allows him to use the ground to help generate power. Well-executed backfoot breaking balls, however, are Kryptonite to Roden's bat path; he struggles to scoop those, and swings over the top of them. He's adept at flattening his bat path to cover high fastballs to drive them the other way, but tends to expand the zone against them a little too often. 
Roden received heavy consideration for the Top 100 list. Three things shaded his grade down into more of a platoon role. He's much more chase-prone against fastballs and with two strikes (both relative to his chase in other counts, and to the big league average with two strikes), which suggests that his excellent walk rates from the minors will dip in the big leagues. He's also a boxy 25-year-old, and I worry that he'll be subject to athletic decline during his six-year window of team control. Roden is not currently on Toronto's 40-man, and the Blue Jay's big league corner outfield situation is very, very crowded. It's imperative for things to shake out among the Loperfido/Barger/Lukes/Wagner group pairing with George Springer and playing opposite Anthony Santander. It might not be until 2026 that Roden, who will then be 26, gets to entrench himself as a Pavin Smith type contributor."
Deivid Coronil,SS,SDP,2031,,40+,High,17.5,40,45,45,55,"Coronil has a projection-driven profile at shortstop. He's shown burgeoning strength and power as signing day approaches. A graceful, low-to-the-ground defender, he makes effortless throws to first base on routine plays and has a good shot to stay at shortstop. His offensive output will depend on how much stronger Coronil can get. He had a slash-and-dash look for most of the commitment window, then more physicality arrived throughout 2024. There's hit tool risk, but Coronil otherwise checks a lot of exciting boxes."
Daniel Hernandez,C,WSN,2031,,40+,High,17.1,55,50,50,40,"Hernandez has a beautiful left-handed swing. He's wiry and athletic and has room for strength without compromising his athleticism. In addition to needing to get stronger in order to withstand the beating of catching, Hernandez needs to find a way to improve his throwing. His raw arm strength is okay, but his exchange is slow. This is a high-ceiling offensive catching prospect with enormous risk, mostly because of his position."
Ethan Pecko,SP,HOU,2027,,40+,Med,22.6,,,,,"Pecko went to high school a little southwest of Philadelphia and began his college career as a La Salle Explorer. He never pitched there as he recovered from TJ, and transferred to Towson for his sophomore and junior years, but only threw 59.2 career innings as a Tiger. Since entering pro ball, the Astros have augmented his delivery some, most obviously his stride direction, and Pecko's fastball has become lethal. It has huge riding action and uphill angle that make it a potential plus-plus offering even though it sits just 92-94 mph. Pecko's slider garnered plus chase and miss rates in college, but he hasn't been able to replicate that in pro ball, though his breaking balls do have plus raw spin rates. This is a very exciting developmental arm who K'd 31% of opponents in a swingman role, reached Double-A, and won Houston's Minor League Pitcher of the Year award."
Wikelman Gonzalez,MIRP,CHW,2025,,40+,High,23,,,,,"Gonzalez became famous starting in 2021 when he and his monster stuff dominated the FCL enough to merit a promotion to full-season ball before the end of the year — while he was still just 19 years old. Since then he’s been an untameable tease and struggled pretty badly with walks. The 2024 season was Gonzalez’s first on Boston’s 40-man roster and a tale of two halves. He ran a 7.38 ERA through the end of June and a 1.98 ERA thereafter. Gonzalez even managed to limit himself to 15 walks over his final 41 innings. He pitched in 24 games during the year but was often so inefficient that several of his starts lasted only three innings, and he threw 83 2/3 total frames. All of Gonzalez’s pitches look incredibly nasty on occasion, but right now he doesn’t execute them consistently enough for any of them to generate an above-average rate of swing-and-miss. His sinking 93-95 mph fastball has always played down a bit due to ineffective shape and poor command, and his secondary stuff (which still looks like it has a ton of movement to the naked eye) has underperformed, too. It’s positive that Gonzalez has now held mid-90s velocity for the last several years, but his command needs to improve if he’s going to be a big league starter. He has fantastic arm speed and it’s plausible that, at age 22, he simply hasn’t corraled it yet. Wild pitchers whose option years start to dwindle often get moved to the bullpen, but the rebuilding White Sox have the time to let Gonzalez struggle and try to make adjustments at the big league level. His ceiling is likely higher in Chicago than in Boston because the former club is more likely to be patient in this regard."
Jack Dreyer,SIRP,LAD,2025,,40+,Med,26.1,,,,,"Jack's dad, Steve, got to the big leagues with the Rangers in the mid-90s. After his freshman season, Jack barely pitched at Iowa due to a shoulder injury, the pandemic, and then a Tommy John. He was a 2021 undrafted free agent, threw a dozen innings as a 23-year-old on the complex in 2022, was walk-prone but otherwise pretty good at High-A in 2023, and then was dominant in 2024, which he spent mostly at Triple-A Oklahoma City. The Pacific Coast League is not easy to pitch in, but Dreyer still posted a sub-1.00 WHIP and 2.20 ERA in 57 innings there. 
His stuff isn't crazy, but Dreyer is incredibly deceptive. Dreyer has the ""invisiball"" fastball. He hides it forever, his whippy arm action suddenly appears from behind his head, and then it has 20 inches of due north vertical break as it explodes toward the plate. Dreyer's fastball generated a crazy amount of chase and miss for a 93 mph pitch, and he's going to be able to rip it past big league hitters. His two breaking balls (a vertical low-80s curve and a 84-89 mph slider) have distinct movement and the change of pace they create with one another seems to make hitters uncomfortable. Counter to norms, Dreyer's slider actually plays better against righties than his curveball. He has the tools to work against hitters of either handedness, mostly because of his fastball. It should allow Dreyer to be a consistent part of a bullpen, and he might end up in the occasional higher-leverage situation."
Johan De Los Santos,CF,PIT,2031,,40+,High,16.7,40,40,40,80,"The brother of Pirates prospect Yordany De Los Santos, Johan is speculatively projected to center field here due to his sketchy infield look at the U18 WBSC tournament in August 2024. He ran a jailbreak 3.8 and 4.0 (meep meep) at that tournament, though. That speed will play in center if development on the infield doesn't occur. De Los Santos' hands are really lively and he rotates with verve through contact. His hands load low, his swing has a late hitch, and it might need adjustment against pro velocity. It's also possible things simplify for him via strength and maturity, and that it won't take a mechanical overhaul at all. He's a Roman Quinn type prospect."
Dorian Soto,SS,BOS,2031,,40+,High,17.1,40,40,50,60,"Soto is a projectable switch-hitting shortstop who has gotten stronger during the commitment window. Both of his swings are very long, but ferocious. He has uncommon power potential from both sides of the plate. His growing size creates risk that he'll need to move off of shortstop. Among the more magmatic, high-variance prospects in the class, there are paths where Soto is a K-prone third baseman and others where he's a 20-homer shortstop."
Jhoan De La Cruz,SS,SDP,2031,,40,High,17.4,50,50,40,55,"Viewed as among the higher-floored players in the class, mostly because of defensive ability at shortstop, De La Cruz runs and throws well enough to stay there; multiple sources describe him as having a high baseball IQ, good instincts, or something of that ilk. De La Cruz has a medium build and below-average bat speed right now, and there are scouts who don't think he will be strong enough to be an impact offensive player. His hands work well in the box. His left-handed swing is driven by his top hand, while his righty swing is a little longer; both are well-balanced and coordinated. De La Cruz has less overt ceiling than most of San Diego's top signees, but he's still a good prospect, with more of a utility look at first blush."
Juan Sanchez,SS,TOR,2031,,40,High,17.5,40,40,50,40,"Sanchez's power and arm strength are his carrying tools. He's a bigger-framed left side infielder with potential strikeout issues. There are lots of corner outfielders and corner infielders with similar profiles in this international class, but Sanchez might do enough to stay at shortstop."
Kenny Fenelon,CF,MIL,2031,,40,High,17.5,30,30,45,60,"Scouts who really like Fenelon think he has a shot to be Mike Cameron. He is a six-foot quarter stick of dynamite with emphatic pull power against pitches in the down-and-in portion of the zone. He's incredibly twitchy and powerful for a hitter his age and size, and he's also fast enough to have a shot to remain in center field. Where Fenelon's profile gets sketchy is his hit tool. There are scouts who worry the amount of contact he made during their looks was entirely insufficient. At a muscular 6-feet, there's not a ton of physical projection here, either. Fenelon is fun and toolsy, but definitely risky."
Caleb Durbin,3B,MIL,2025,,40,Med,25.1,55,60,35,60,"Durbin was a stellar high school wrestler and baseball player who owns several school records in both sports. He would become a Division III baseball standout at Washington University in St. Louis where he posted a career OPS over 1.000. Durbin was a day three pick of the Braves and coasted through the lower minors during his first 18 months in pro ball. After his first full season Durbin was traded to the Yankees as part of the Lucas Luetge deal and he continued a superlative bat-to-ball track record in the upper minors with New York.   He slashed .287/.396/.471 at Triple-A Scranton in 2024 but only played in 90 games during the regular season sue to a fractured wrist. Weeks after he was added to the Yankees 40-man roster he was traded to Milwaukee as part of a package for Devin Williams. Durbin is short — really short, he’s 5-foot-6 — but he’s not small; he’s built like a little tank, like a XS Tyler O'Neill. His compact, stocky build helps keep his swing short and consistently on time to pull the baseball and makes Durbin very difficult to beat inside the strike zone, especially at the top. His quality of contact in 2024 was commensurate with a guy who slugs under .400 at the big league level, but he was dealing with an injury that typically impacts contact quality for a while after recovery and Durbin's spray chart has a pretty extreme airborne pull-side look to it, often a trait of players whose game power outperforms their raw. Here Durbin is not projected to do enough damage to be an everyday player. Because Durbin is a capable defender at both second and third base, and has also been playing all over the outfield, he should be able to play a suitable utility role at lots of non-shortstop positions. Defensive versatility is ths key for Durbin to be rostered consistently. Durbin will post plus run times from home to first on his jailbreak swings, but most of his times are close to 4.4 seconds on his normal swings. That’s not blazing and is slower than what’s typical of a good center fielder, but any kind of outfield viability is meaningul here. The departure of Willy Adames from Milwaukee creates a domino effect that leaves third base unoccupied. Durbin will compete with the likes of Oliver Dunn, Andruw Monasterio, Tyler Black, and Vinny Capra for reps at 3B during Spring Training and could feasibly do some platooning at 2B with Brice Turang. "
Kendry Martinez,2B,SEA,2031,,40,High,17.5,50,45,45,40,"Martinez is an off-the-bus standout thanks to his projectable baseball frame, which is in the Josh Rojas mold. He's relatively short to the baseball with a downhill swing. It's a rhythmic, aesthetically pleasing cut, but Martinez has middling bat speed and explosion. That extends to his athleticism on defense. Scouts have a mix of second base and shortstop projections here; he isn't a lock to play short, and Martinez would need to outperform his hit/power projection to be an impact regular at the keystone."
Brayan Cortesia,SS,WSN,2031,,40,High,17.4,50,50,40,45,"Cortesia is generally considered more of a skills-over-tools utility type. He has the arm to play shortstop but evaluations of the other aspects of his defense are more variable. He has a large frame and somewhat mature build. Barring his hit tool outperforming projections, he looks like solid extra infielder."
Eiberson Castellano,SIRP,MIN,2025,,40,Med,23.9,,,,,"Castellano is a 23-year-old Venezuelan righty who, after two consecutive years at Low-A Clearwater, had a breakout 2024 and ended the season at Double-A Reading. Across 20 starts (22 games), he worked 103.2 innings, twice the innings of each of his previous two seasons. Here Castellano is projected as a reliever long-term. He’s been on and off the IL with back spasms and until 2024, he hadn’t demonstrated anything near starter-level durability or control. Castellano’s command is not as good to the eye as his 2024 2.52 BB/9 mark might indicate. That was comfortably a career-best walk rate for Castellano, who is a below-average athlete with a fairly inconsistent release. His changeup usage was up late in 2024, as if the Phillies were trying to see whether it would improve enough for them to roster him. Some of his changeups look good, but too many of them find the meat of the zone. If that pitch can grow, then Castellano has a shot to be a starter, albeit an inefficient one. He has a plus curveball and can mix sinkers and four-seamers together in the 93-95 mph range; the latter are fairly hittable. The middle relief forecast here assumes a velocity uptick in one-inning bursts, which will help Castellano’s fastball play a little better than it does now."
Chase Meidroth,SS,CHW,2025,,40,Med,23.7,60,70,30,40,"The 23-year-old Meidroth is a fascinating player who generates wildly divergent opinions from scouts, with some considering him a potential star and others evaluating him as light-hitting utility infielder. I fall into the latter group. Meidroth has more pro walks than strikeouts, is a .285/.425/.408 career hitter in the minors, and slashed .293/.437/.401 at Triple-A Worcester in 2024. His granular contact data is absurd. Meidroth posted a 92% in-zone contact rate and 3.2% swinging strike rate in 2024, and has had among the best bat-to-ball metrics in pro baseball since he signed out of the University of San Diego. At a stocky 5-foot-10, he is able to keep his fairly elaborate swing on time enough to spray a ton of contact toward the opposite field, much of it on the ground. Meidroth has posted groundball rates near 50% since reaching the upper levels of the minors, an issue severe enough that, for reasons related to his contact quality, it detracts from his projected hit tool as well as his power. Meidroth will tomahawk the occasional high pitch with extra base power, but most of his contact is of the low-lying variety, with lots of oppo pokes and slaps. It’s pleasing to watch, but isn't especially impactful.
Meidroth has developed quite a bit as a defensive player in pro ball. He struggled to make accurate throws from second base in college, and it wasn't clear what position he might end up playing. He has improved as an infielder and gotten reps at shortstop and third base in addition to his native second. Meidroth still produces the occasional errant throw, but his actions and range are both fine for short. He could play there in a pinch, but that isn't ideal due to his arm. Jamey Carroll’s offensive output is a pretty good proxy for what to expect from Meidroth — it’s enough for him to be a big league role player, but probably not a Steven Kwan sequel despite the swinging strike excellence."
Warren Calcano,SS,KCR,2031,,40,High,17.4,,,,,"Calcaño is a lanky, projectable, switch-hitting shortstop with a defense-oriented toolset. A slick defender with very good range, his arm projects to be a fit on the left side of the infield. Calcaño has tracked pitches in games, including at the Future Stars Series and Perfect Game events. He needs to get much, much stronger to have anything resembling big league physicality. He isn't currently strong enough to replicate his BP swing in games, and he has a long, bottom-hand dominant cut that would limit him to slash-and-dash style of hitting unless there's progress made in this area. Calcaño's ceiling is more reasonably in the utility area."
Royel Strop,CF,STL,2031,,40,High,16.8,40,40,45,60,"The son of former (and recent) big league reliever Pedro Strop, Royel is a projectable center field prospect with above-average bat speed. His swing has a hitch that might need to be cleaned up in pro ball. If it isn't, there could be a lot of strikeouts here. Strop has the speed to develop in center field for now, but he's big enough that a move to a corner is possible. If he does have to move, it will be to left field due to a lack of arm strength."
Jose Luis Pena,SS,BAL,2031,,40,High,16.6,,,,,"One of the youngest prospects in the 2025 Class, Peña has gotten stronger during the commitment window. From the jump, he's been a viable shortstop prospect with good speed, but now he looks like he also has a shot to do some damage on offense if he can keep getting stronger."
William Kempner,SIRP,MIA,2026,,40,High,23.8,,,,,"Kempner went to high school in San Jose and took a little less money than he could have had gotten elsewhere to become a Giant. He has dealt with injury issues throughout his career, including biceps and finger flexor tendon issues in college, and a fractured foot that cost him all of the 2024 regular season. Kempner seemed to hit his stride upon moving to the bullpen in 2023, after which he carried a 30% strikeout rate. He looked good in his couple of 2024 Arizona Fall League innings, as he sat 95-97 and ben in a slider that sometimes had 20 inches of horizontal movement. He's a fairly explosive hip-and-shoulder athlete with a low release, a popular trope in San Francisco's system. Kempner's health and conditioning add volatility to his prospectdom, but when he's been healthy he's looked like a good middle reliever. He was traded to the Marlins in exchange for international pool space at the start of the 2025 signing period."
Brayan Mendoza,SP,MIA,2026,,40,Low,21.2,,,,,"Mendoza is a 21-year-old Venezuelan lefty who worked 101 very efficient innings at (mostly) Low-A Down East in 2024. He's a relatively high-floored prospect, especially for his age, because he has the classic over-achieving lefty starter scouting profile: He has a great changeup and polished command. 
Mendoza seems to have altered his changeup grip in 2024 (the previous season's TrackMan data had his pitch tagged as a splitter) and the results were significant. The pitch now has a traditional circle change look and enough action to miss bats; it generated chase and miss rates north of 40% in 2024. Mendoza also added a couple of ticks to his breaking ball, an offering with 10-to-4 movement that straddles 80 mph, and works best as a strike-stealer, and less well as a chase pitch. A key variable for Mendoza will be maintaining his current 92-ish mph fastball velocity in spite of his size (he's 5-foot-11 or so). In a way, his lack of size aids in his fastball's effectiveness because it creates uphill angle on the pitch, allowing it to miss bats at the belt. In the heart of the zone, it is very vulnerable. Mendoza has a minimalistic delivery with a short arm stroke and he repeats it with fantastic consistency. He's not an especially explosive athlete, but he is quite coordinated and always looks well-balanced on the mound. This forecast has Mendoza tracking as a quick-moving backend starter. If his fastball velocity sags as his workload grows, then an outcome more like Tommy Milone is likely."
Darell Morel,3B,PIT,2031,,40,High,17.5,40,40,50,50,"Morel had a deal with the Dodgers for a little north of $1 million but worked out for teams the week before signing day (in Dodgers gear) and was offered (and agreed to) $1.8 million by Pittsburgh the next day. He's a super lanky and projectable infielder with a plus arm and plus power projection. Morel's size at maturity will likely lead to a third base fit. There's hit tool risk here; scouts have seen him whiff during BP. Morel has a risky, high-upside corner profile."
Harold Rivas,CF,BOS,2031,,40,High,16.9,40,40,45,60,Rivas is a speedy center field prospect whose defensive ceiling is meaningful because of his speed and arm strength. The sinewy outfielder also has an aggressive swing that generates plus bat speed. Rivas' swing is very long and he requires a ton of effort to swing hard. Whether or not he'll be able to successfully track pro pitches with a swing like this is debatable. Rivas' defense gives him a reasonable extra outfielder floor. Outcomes above that will depend on him outperforming this hit tool projection.
Christopher Acosta,SS,MIL,2031,,35+,High,17.2,45,45,30,50,"Acosta is a good little athlete who requires a lot of effort to swing hard. Even as he's become stronger during the commitment window and Acosta's swing has become better connected, his head still whips around when he takes a bigger hack; it might speak to issues against pro quality stuff. Acosta doesn't have monster tools on either side of the ball. He's well-rounded and athletic but not especially explosive, and he has a realistic utility fit."
Chad Patrick,SP,MIL,2025,,35+,Low,26.6,,,,,"A 2021 fourth round pick by Arizona, Patrick has been traded a couple of times in the last year, first for Jace Peterson and then for Abraham Toro. He has a five-pitch mix headlined by a good cutter, which he mixes with his fastball at the top of the zone. There isn't a plus secondary pitch here, but Patrick throws a ton of strikes and is graded here as a spot starter."
Haritzon Castillo,SS,MIN,2031,,35+,High,17,55,55,35,55,"An advanced contact hitter, Castillo is also a suitable shortstop with enough arm and range for short. Like so many others in this class, he has a realistic utility ceiling."
Santiago Leon,SS,MIN,2031,,35+,High,16.8,45,45,40,50,"Leon has a medium frame and has become meaningfully stronger during the commitment window. His max-effort arm strength is above-average but his arm accuracy is a tad spotty. Still, he otherwise has a favorable shortstop projection. Leon's build at time of signing limits his long-term power projection. He has average bat speed, and his swing has a loopy uphill path through contact. It's more of a utility ceiling look."
Diego Cartaya,C,MIN,2027,,35+,High,23.6,30,30,45,30,"Cartaya was a big bonus amateur player ($2.5 mil) whose career had a very promising first four seasons. He slashed .254/.389/.503 in 2022, at mostly High-A, when Cartaya will still just a 20-year-old. He was striking out at an elevated rate (26.7%) at the time, but he was also getting to impressive power and playing a premium position. His big frame and plus raw arm strength were the foundation of a likely defensive fit at catcher, and at the time it felt fine that Cartaya (who had missed all of 2020 because of the COVID shutdown, and most of 2021 due to injury) was a little behind as a receiver and ball-blocker. In the two seasons since then, Cartaya has either plateaued or regressed in basically every facet of the game. His hands are below average and this shows in the way he tries to frame borderline pitches, and in the way he tries to pick balls in the dirt. He's capable of hurling darts right to second base with plus pop times, but Cartaya often either takes too long to get rid of the baseball, or airmails throws into center field. He has a good arm, yet has allowed stolen bases at an 80% success rate in his minor league career, 84% in 2024. At a mix of Double- and Triple-A, Cartaya hit .189/.278/.379 in 2023 (his first year on the Dodgers 40-man roster) and .221/.323/.363 in 2024. His measurable power (41% hard hit rate in 2022, 33% in 2024) has dipped. It's prudent to give young catchers a long runway to develop as hitters because their bodies take a beating playing defense, and they might be compromised for large chunks of a season such that it impacts their overall offensive output. But Cartaya has now had two years with the look of a fringe prospect, and so at this point it's fair to consider him exactly that. He's still a big-framed young guy with that big arm, and the Twins have had success at developing guys who were once considered long shots to remain behind the plate, so Cartaya still carries some prospect value."
Alejandro Cruz,3B,CHW,2031,,35+,High,18.2,40,40,40,40,"Cruz is a projectable third baseman with below-average bat speed at present. He's a slick third base defender and advanced on-field decision maker. His arm strength is a little light for third base right now, but should arrive as Cruz matures. How much that also applies to his power and strength with the bat in his hands will dictate whether he can be a threat on offense."
Juan Carela,SIRP,CHW,2025,,35+,Med,23.3,,,,,"Acquired from the Yankees in the Keynan Middleton trade of 2023, Carela is a lanky starter prospect who has worked 100-ish innings each of the last three seasons, topping out at Double-A, where he made seven starts in 2024. Carela has a relief projection here due to him lacking a weapon to neutralize lefties. He uses a slider-heavy approach, actually throwing his sweeper-style slider, which has plus two-plane wipe, more than his heater. His fastball and cutter diverge laterally to stay off barrels. Carela's lower arm slot makes it tough for his changeup to finish with sink. He should begin his big league career as up/down spot starter, and eventually will either need to polish his command or changeup if he's to remain in a starter role once his option years run out."
Matt Svanson,SIRP,STL,2025,,35+,Low,26.2,,,,,"Svanson is a pretty standard middle relief prospect with a 94-96 mph fastball and an above-average mid-80s slider. His fastball's shape causes it to play down, putting him in more of an up/down bucket than a comfortable middle-inning role."
Lieberts Aponte,SS,CIN,2031,,35+,High,17.4,40,30,30,55,"One of the many defense-first shortstops in the class, Aponte is a very twitchy, undersized infielder with great hands and actions. He desperately needs to get stronger to have any shot of hitting enough to be a regular big leaguer."
Cooper Bowman,CF,CIN,2025,,35+,Med,25.2,45,55,35,60,"Bowman, the Yankees’ 2021 fourth rounder out of Louisville, came to the A’s via the 2022 Frankie Montas trade. He’s a career .246/.346/.401 hitter in the minors and posted a .844 OPS over 80 games at Double-A Midland in 2024 before he was promoted to Triple-A for the final 38 games of the year and struggled (.592 OPS). Bowman plays solid defense at both second base and in center field, which gives him valuable versatility, and he’s a good baserunner, swiping bags 43 in 49 attempts last season. He’s performed like a roughly average contact hitter with below-average power, sufficient for a lower-impact utility role. Right now, TJ Friedl patrols center field while Matt McLain (who got center field reps in the Arizona Fall League) occupies second base, so Bowman would seem to be competing with versatile infielder Santiago Espinal and 2B/LF Tyler Callihan for an Opening Day roster spot."
Nick Mitchell,RF,CLE,2028,,35+,Med,21.6,55,60,35,50,"Mitchell is a relatively small corner outfield prospect who hit for superlative contact in college and during a brief post-draft run at Low-A Dunedin. He was traded to the Guardians as part of the Andrés Giménez deal. Mitchell's college career began at Western Illinois (they're the Leathernecks), where he hit a combined .348 in two seasons and led the team in every offensive category as a sophomore. Mitchell transferred to Indiana for his draft season and played right field all year, amassing a .335/.458/.512 line despite missing time at the very start of the season with a broken hand. Toronto drafted Mitchell in the fourth round, signed him for a little less than $500,000, and then he went out and hit .289/.350/.467 at Dunedin during the last month of the minor league season. 
Mitchell is a small-framed 5-foot-10 but takes a healthy rip for a guy his size. His athleticism is evident in the verve of his best swings, but Mitchell generates it without elaborate movement; his swing is simple and compact, and generates all-fields line drive spray. He made in-zone contact at a 90% rate at both IU and Dunedin, though his chase rate took a leap in pro ball (something to watch going forward). Mitchell's power-indicating metrics, like his hard-hit rate and peak exit velocities, are comfortably below average but need to be viewed with his preseason broken hand in mind. Though they were roughly the same in pro ball, even as Mitchell got furher and further away from his injury, he should be monitored for an uptick in this area in 2025. The Blue Jays gave Michell some reps in center field after the draft and his feel for the position isn't great. He played exclusively right field at Indiana and doesn't always look great in right either (though Mitchell throws well). Barring a meaningful uptick in his power, Mitchell's profile is similar to that of current Guardians outfielder Will Brennan — a good contact-hitting corner guy with significantly less power than is typical for an everyday guy. Mitchell could be a similar platoon type player."
Jose Vasquez,SIRP,LAD,2029,,35+,High,20.3,,,,,"Vasquez signed with Minnesota at the tail end of the 2022 signing period (December 13th) for $120,000, and he spent both 2023 and 2024 in the DSL. After walking more than a batter per inning in his debut season, Vasquez had a much better second campaign as he worked 2-to-4 innings at a time, as both a starter and reliever, and amassed 30.2 IP, 45 K, and a much more tenable 15 walks. Despite his strike-throwing improvement, Vasquez is still most likely going to be a reliever. He's a physical, 220-ish pound 20-year-old who has had trouble harnessing his 94-97 mph fastball, which sometimes has very heavy late sink. His 84-88 mph slider is curt and cuttery at times, but flashes bat-missing two-plane shape and above-average length. Vasquez's realistic ceiling is better than a generic middle reliever, but he's maybe a half decade away from the bigs. He'll likely begin his Dodgers career in Extended Spring Training. "
Elorky Rodriguez,LF,TEX,2031,,35+,High,17.3,55,55,40,45,"Elorky is a compact corner outfield prospect with a great-looking swing. Of smaller, more mature build, it's tough to project prototypical corner power for Rodriguez, but he might have a balanced enough offensive skill set to be a righty-mashing platoon type."
Kevin Defrank,SP,MIA,2031,,35+,High,16.6,,,,,"Defrank was associated with a couple of teams during the scouting process but seems to have settled with Miami on a mid-six-figure bonus. He is one of the better pitchers in the 2025 class, a prototypical 6-foot-3 righty whose fastball has already peaked in the mid-90s; based on his build, delivery, and athleticism, that velo is likely to increase as he matures. He also has a fair changeup."
Echedry Vargas,2B,MIA,2027,,35+,High,20.1,30,50,45,55,"Vargas has been on the fringes of Rangers prospect lists for the last few years despite excellent surface-level performance because he's among the most impatient hitters in all of pro baseball. He chased at a 44% rate in 2024 and at a whopping 59% with two strikes. Vargas is also a small-framed player and lacks physical projection (and the arm strength to project at shortstop) despite his age; the long-term ceiling on his power is capped at average or below. Vargas' hitting hands are quick and authoritative for a guy his size and his top hand drives his swing, which allows him to get on top of high fastballs and make a ton of airborne, pull-side contact. He's a bizarre prospect on paper, one of extremes both good (the quality of Vargas' contact despite middling raw power) and bad (he swings at everything and probably can't play shortstop). The lack of shortstop viability here is big. Vargas' lack of size and prototypical arm strength might confine him to second base, which makes it tough to projeect him as a flawed but fun utilityman. It puts his profile on fairly thin ice, and his impatience as a hitter means Vargas is standing on that ice wearing shoes made of lava."
Liam Hicks,C,MIA,2025,,35+,Low,25.8,60,70,30,30,"Hicks was drafted in the 2021 ninth round out of Arkansas State and signed for $30,000. He made plus rates of contact all the way up through Double-A with the Rangers before he was traded to the Tigers at the 2024 deadline as part of the package for Carson Kelly. He’s a .274/.405/.374 career hitter in the minors and has a unique statistical profile thanks to his combination of contact ability (he had a 6% swinging strike rate in 2024) and the extreme uphill launch created by his swing. He takes his cuts bent at the waist with his hands over the top of the zone and his bat has a vertical angle through contact. Hicks had an 18 degree average launch angle in 2024, near the top of what is sustainable at the big league level. As you can probably tell from his career SLG, Hicks lacks the power to weaponize his bat path. In fact his contact is so light that it detracts a bit from his ability to hit for average even though he’s making so much of it. Hicks has also struggled to develop on defense. Too often he just whiffs on catching pitches altogether, and he gives up a ton of long rebounds on balls in the dirt. It’s possible his defense will not allow him to stick on Miami’s roster. A fascinating statistical outlier, Hicks projects as a team’s third catcher long-term."
Luarbert Arias,SP,MIA,2025,,35+,Low,24.3,,,,,"Arias was on the prospect radar as a very young Padres pitcher because of his precocious strike-throwing ability, but he lacked physical projection, his stuff plateaued even with a move to the bullpen, and he was exposed to the minor league Rule 5 draft, which is how the Marlins came to acquire him. He's struck out more than a batter per inning in each season since 2019 with a fairly standard mid-90s fastball/slider combo. Neither pitch is devastating enough to project Luarbert into a cemented on-roster role, and he looks more like a reliable up/down option."
Justin Hagenman,SP,NYM,2025,,35,Low,28.5,,,,,"Hagenman was drafted in the now defunct 23rd round out of Penn State and, after parts of six seasons in the Dodgers org, was traded to the Red Sox in the 2023 Enrique Hernández deal. He elected free agency after the 2024 season and was quickly picked up by the Mets on a big league deal. Hagenman is a funky starter who mixes his four pitches very evenly, with his cutter, slider, and changeup usage all hovering around 20%. None of his stuff is plus, and he looks more like a depth starter or swingman than a true on-roster contributor."
Blake Mitchell,C,KCR,2027,,45+,High,20.7,30,30,55,35,"Mitchell was a great two-way high school prospect in Texas who often competed with, and stood out among, kids who were a year or two older than him at showcase events. He was into the mid-90s on the mound and showed huge left-handed power for his age in the batter's box. The risk associated with high school catchers is already high, and Mitchell's profile added more because he did quite a bit of swinging and missing on the pre-draft circuit. 
Mitchell's first full pro season reinforced his amateur scouting report. He slashed .238/.376/.439 and hit 18 homers at Low-A Columbia, but he also struck out 30.5% of the time and struggled a good bit on defense, especially early in the year. Mitchell catches from a such a low one-knee'd crouch that it looks like he's trying to win a roller skating limbo. His hands and technique picking balls in the dirt improved a ton throughout 2024. Next for Mitchell might be getting his arm to play closer to his talent level. He's a very athletic mover and has a huge arm, and he probably would have been a really good college reliever. But Mitchell only caught runners at a 15% clip in 2024 and allowed 113 stolen bases, often leaving his crouch too late. His defensive improvement last season is important because his overall ceiling as a player is going to be dictated by how good of a catcher he becomes. 
Mitchell's future at the plate is much more clear. He lacks barrel feel and he's going to strike out a ton (his seasonal batting averages might hover around .200), but he can really swing it and is going to have plus lefty power, maybe more. There are outcomes where Mitchell strikes out so much that his career mimics Alex Jackson's or Zack Collins', but if he develops into an at least average defender, then something akin to Tom Murphy or Jarrod Saltalamacchia seems very doable."
Charlie Condon,3B,COL,2027,,45+,High,22,30,30,60,40,"Condon set an SEC freshman record for homers as a redshirt frosh and slugged .800 in his first season of reps for the Bulldogs. He came into the 2024 season ranked 24th on the FanGraphs draft board due to concerns about his hit tool, then slashed .433/.556/1.009 (seriously) and hit 37 homers in 60 games, albeit during an historic season for offense in college baseball. Condon went third overall, signed for $9.25 million, and then had a no good very bad pro debut at Spokane during which he hit .180 and struck out 31.2% of the time. During instructs, Condon played defense but didn't get at-bats, as if he was being given time away from the plate to reset. Perhaps because I was already relatively skeptical of Condon's contact ability before the draft, I am reading his post-draft performance as signal, rather than a small sample aberration or the result of exhaustion. 
Condon's swing is relatively grooved and stiff. He swings really hard and has an incredible ability to turn on pitches on the inner third, especially for a 6-foot-6 guy, but Condon doesn't have great feel for manipulating the barrel. His swing generates enormous power on pitches down and in, but it lacks precision and variability in other parts of the zone, and he has hit tool risk despite his college performance. He was late on basically everything after the draft and wholly unable to pull the ball, which wasn't the case when he was at Georgia, where Condon had a 90% contact rate against fastballs. 
How much room Condon's contact issues will have to breathe is going to depend on where he ends up playing defense. He played third base, first base, and all three outfield spots during his time in Athens and third base, and left field after the draft. Condon bends well for a player his size, but his range at the hot corner is well below average. He is a better thrower from the outfield than he is from third base, and I thought he looked surprisingly skillful in center field at Georgia, though he's a 40-grade runner and likely not a long-term fit there. Here Condon is projected as a flawed but powerful multi-positional role player rather than an impact third baseman."
Josuar De Jesus Gonzalez,SS,SFG,2031,,45+,High,17.3,50,45,55,60,"De Jesus Gonzalez is a potential five-tool player who was my top non-Roki Sasaki player in the 2025 international amateur class. A switch-hitting shortstop, De Jesus Gonzalez is an explosive rotator with electric bat speed. He unwinds with rare verve, and the bend in his lower body allows for low-ball power. His right-handed swing is less coordinated, but still dangerous. De Jesus Gonzalez's medium frame limits his raw power projection somewhat, but there's enough bat speed to project above-average pop. His front side can drift toward first base, suggesting potential breaking ball vulnerability. Otherwise, he looks like a good hitter with playable power in a lot of the zone. The twitch, range, actions, and arm for shortstop all are present, and he's universally acclaimed as a lock to stick at short by scouts who have seen him there. Others have seen him work out in center field and thought that was a good fit, too. Josuar has a very strong heuristic profile as a switch-hitting up-the-middle player with power, and he has All-Star ceiling if his hit tool is average or better."
Christian Moore,2B,LAA,2025,,45+,High,22.4,40,40,55,50,"Moore finished his incredible career at Tennessee with a .375/.451/.797 line as a junior in a season where he also hit 34 bombs, twice as many as in his sophomore year. He has dangerous pole-to-pole power and performed at a superlative level against college baseball's premier conference. He was the 2024 draft's eighth overall pick, signed for $5 million, and was quickly sent to Double-A Rocket City, seemingly on the fast track to Anaheim like so many of the Angels' recent high draft picks. He missed a few weeks with a meniscus injury but was back before the end of the season and played in Instructional League. 
Moore has profile-carrying power for a middle infielder. He sports a pretty standard leg kick (he cuts it with two strikes) and a very aggressive hand position when he loads, with the tip of his bat pointed back toward the pitcher at his load's apex. His hands work with bloodthirsty loft, and he generates big time leverage with his lower half throughout his swing. Moore is most dangerous against pitches in the lower part of the strike zone, but he gets beaten up around the belt pretty regularly. His combination of breaking ball chase and vulnerability to high fastballs is what largely drove my bearish pre-draft hit tool projection and overall ranking (23rd in the class). Moore did a ton of in-zone whiffing at Tennessee and then again after the draft. He slashed .322/.378/.533 at Double-A, but struck out at a 30% clip and posted a 72% in-zone contact rate, which would be among the bottom handful of big league hitters. There are only a few productive second basemen who strike out as much as Moore did at Tennessee (20% K% during his career) and most of them hit left-handed (Brandon Lowe, for example). Moore is very likely to have a below-average hit tool (even at peak) and rely on his power production to profile as an everyday guy. 
Moore could also use some polish on defense. He has below-average hands and lateral footwork, and is a ""waist bender"" whose knees often stay locked as he fields, which can make for some awkward looking actions. But Moore plays with big time effort and zeal, and is willing to leave his feet to make tough plays if he has to. He gets by at second base on guts much more than skill or athleticism. It's tough to find precedent for top 15 players at the keystone who strike out as much as Moore projects to (especially among right-handed hitters), particularly when they also aren't versatile or exceptional defensive players. There are scouts who think Moore will have to move to left field (he tried third base at instructs), and some of those folks still love him because they think he'll get to enough power to profile there. I am on the skeptical end of things and think that while Moore could have a big power-hitting season or two, for the most part he'll perform like a second-division regular."
Spencer Jones,CF,NYY,2026,,45+,High,23.9,30,30,60,60,"Jones' strikeouts have been steadily climbing as he's traversed the minors, and they reached an untenable area in 2024, as he K'd at a 36.8% clip at Double-A Somerset. At this point, assessing Jones is less about scouting him and more about where you value his potential late-blooming profile as a prospect. He can't keep striking out this much and still be a steady, successful big leaguer, so how much improvement does he have left in the tank? His background, of course, includes several traits that could account for Jones’ slow burn. He was a real prospect on both sides of the ball in high school, then serious injuries limited him to just 48 games during his first two years of college. He only began playing the outfield as a junior and center field in pro ball. Plus, Jones is enormous and could conceivably still be growing into feel for his body, even at nearly 24 years old. 
These traits have been part of why Jones was so exciting a year ago. His strikeouts were manageable, he was getting to his titanic power, and he conceivably could have kept improving for those aforementioned reasons. Instead, he regressed and often looked stiff and imbalanced at the dish last year. Jones had a poor-but-viable 70% contact rate in 2023 and then posted a 59% rate (basically no big leaguers have such a low mark) in 2024. Per Synergy Sports, the average fastball he faced in 2024 (93.5 mph) was two-ticks harder than the prior season, and Jones' ability to be on time against heaters took a huge nosedive. Jones is still a very dangerous hitter because his swing is tailored to produce enormous power when he actually makes contact. His 57% hard-hit rate was among the best handful in all of pro ball, and a high percentage of Jones' contact is both hard and airborne. And power is not Jones' lone plus tool; he's also shockingly fast for his size and should be a good outfield defender at peak. This could mean his feel for center field improves enough for him to stay there, or Jones could be a plus corner defender with rare range. If Jones' contact rate can rebound to the 70% area, then he'll rejoin the Top 100 as a projected impact player. If it remains closer to 60%, then he's tracking more like Matt Wallner or Sam Hilliard."
Cam Caminiti,SP,ATL,2029,,45+,High,18.6,,,,,"Caminiti was generally considered one of the best high school pitching prospects in the 2024 draft for his entire scouting timeline. He has a lanky, prototypical 6-foot-2 frame with a loose, whippy arm action. Caminiti's arm stroke was habitually late during his pre-draft summer and fall, but was much more consistent during his senior spring. Up to 97, he sits 94-96 throughout most of his outings, then is down in the 92-93 range late. His fastball has a vertical movement orientation and average life. He also features big depth on a 1-to-7 upper-70s curveball and added a lateral slider (80-84 mph) during his senior spring. The changeup projection felt more favorable as last year's draft approached because of Caminiti's improved release consistency. He has perhaps more risk of struggling with strike-throwing than most premium high school lefties because of his prior inconsistency, but the ingredients of a four-pitch mid-rotation starter are here, and Caminiti is now in an org with a pretty good developmental track record."
Brody Brecht,SP,COL,2027,,45+,High,22.5,,,,,"Brecht didn't sign coming out of high school in part because he wanted to play football at Iowa. He redshirted as a freshman, caught nine balls as a sophomore, and then focused solely on baseball as a junior. Walks have been an enormous problem for Brecht. He had more walks than inning pitched as a freshman, and 135 walks in 178 career innings for the Hawkeyes. He also had among the best stuff in the 2024 draft class, and has a rare combination of physicality and athleticism. 
Brecht will sit 96 (he was 95-98 during instructs) and has touched 101. He has a relatively short stride down the mound for someone as big and athletic as he is, and his generic three-quarters slot has a negative impact on his fastball's shape and movement. It plays well below an average pitch even though it has plus-plus velocity. Whatever can be done to help Brecht command his fastball or improve its movement will ideally be implemented without altering his slider, which is an 80-grade SOB that evokes Dinelson Lamet's upper-80s power breaker. Brecht also has a goofy low-90s changeup with big tail and fade. His secondary pitches diverge in such a way that makes it hard to stay on both of them at the same time. 
Built like a marble statue at 6-foot-4 and 235 pounds, Brecht hasn't been focused on baseball for very long and also hasn't yet been in a developmental environment that can max him out, though that might still be true because Colorado's developmental track record for arms isn't great. The gap between where he is as a pitcher right now and what he could be is very large. There is precedent for teams solving issues like Brecht's (Carlos Rodón's command was a mess, too, though maybe not this bad), and he has enormous upside if someone can. Those right tail outcomes are absolutely baked into his FV grade, as is Brecht's risk. At worst, Brecht looks like a potential late-inning reliever who works off of his secondary pitches more than his fastball. He could be a three-pitch mid-rotation stalwart if he and Colorado can find better control."
Konnor Griffin,RF,PIT,2029,,45+,High,18.9,40,40,55,70,"Griffin went wire-to-wire as one of the most talented high school players from the 2024 draft class during its two-plus year scouting window. He was a super-projectable SS/RF as an underclassman and got into the mid-90s on the mound. He has already grown considerably stronger and is now a hulking 6-foot-4, 225 pounds. Griffin played shortstop for his 6A State Champion high school team in Mississippi, but mostly played right field in games with Team USA and at select events; he's probably a little too stiff to play the infield in pro ball. The speed with which Griffin can go zero to 60 at his size is incredible. He takes huge, powerful strides and motors around the bases with a rooster tail of dirt kicking up from his spikes. His reads and routes in the outfield aren't great even though Griffin has the speed for center field, which is why he was mostly relegated to right on Team USA. 
Griffin's bat-to-ball track record was very good across multiple years on the showcase circuit, but long levers often make him late on fastballs, and this will probably get worse in pro ball. Griffin looks a little less limber now that he's filled out, and some of the funky ways he'd move to get the bat on the ball have gone away as he's stiffened, but getting strong was probably the most realistic pathway to a shorter swing. He still has incredible twitch for a prospect his size and has a shot to have both plus-plus raw power and speed at maturity (only one is projected here), plus it's probably worth trying to develop Griffin in center field. The more he focuses solely on that, the better his feel for the outfield could become."
Jansel Luis,SS,ARI,2027,,45+,High,20.1,40,50,55,50,"Luis is a hard-swinging teenage infielder with a chance to grow into plus power. His hands are incredibly fast and authoritative from both sides of the plate, and he's a threat to do extra-base damage on basically any pitch he makes contact with. He won't turn 20 until March, and his well-composed frame has room for another 15 or 20 pounds of muscle without compromising his agility. Luis can also move the barrel around the zone fairly well for such a young switch-hitter, but he doesn't track the baseball. He chases and swings through hittable pitches that he just seems to lose sight of mid-hack. These issues create bust risk associated with Luis' hit tool, especially if he gets too big to play shortstop, or if his skills there stagnate. 
Luis has a similarly exciting-but-raw look on defense. He's a good athlete with great range and a well-calibrated internal clock, but he also has below-average hands, which not only prevent him from completing some spectacular plays but from making some more routine ones as well. His throwing stroke is also a little bit odd, but Luis can pretty effortlessly zip the baseball over to first base from anywhere on the left side of the infield, and this might only get easier for him as he matures. Luis remains more of a developmental prospect than one of imminent big league relevance, but he has a big ceiling as a switch-hitting middle infielder with power and is a potential everyday player, even if he continues to have issues with chase."
Denzel Clarke,CF,ATH,2025,,45+,High,24.9,30,30,45,70,"Clarke, whose mother was a Canadian Olympian, was perhaps the first athlete to ever blow up at the MLB Draft Combine, as he wowed during BP and the athletic testing at the inaugural event in 2021. A small school college prospect, Clarke is your quintessential athletic developmental project, even now at age 24. He has an XL NFL wide receiver's frame at a cut 6-foot-4, 220 pounds; it takes him just a handful of strides to glide from base to base, and he has plus raw power. 
Where Clarke has developed most as a pro is in center field. He is arguably a plus center field defender right now. His feel for running to spots has improved, he has elite top-end speed, he takes bold risks with dives, and he did some absolutely ridiculous stuff around the outfield wall during his stint in the Arizona Fall League. With his size, athleticism and bold creativity, Clarke is going to have a very long big league career as a premium center field defender. 
His feel for hitting hasn't really progressed, with many of his swings still looking poorly timed and mechanically awkward. Clarke's levers and swing are very long, and he basically can't pull fastballs. His splits against above-average velocity are really bad and there's a good chance Clarke will have big league heaters chucked past him with regularity. Clarke has been able to get to power in games despite striking out roughly 30% of the time for his entire career. He crushes mistake breaking balls and creates extra-base hits with his legs. There's a chance that Clarke will have a relevant offensive peak deep into his 20s where he has so much power that he's productive despite near bottom-of-the-scale contact. In the meantime, Clarke's glove will play. He's going to be a meaningfully good part-time outfielder and pinch-runner, and he might already be better suited for that role than Esteury Ruiz."
Owen Murphy,SP,ATL,2027,,45+,Med,21.5,,,,,"Like a lot of Braves' draft targets, Murphy was a two-way high school prospect with gorgeous mechanics. He enjoyed a little velocity uptick his senior year of high school but didn't sustain it through his first full pro season, with his heater back in the 88-92 mph range during an otherwise solid 2023 campaign. Murphy threw 89.2 innings, with 113 strikeouts and 32 walks, and ended the season at High-A. He was off to a hot start in 2024 (though he was not throwing any harder) when he blew his UCL and needed TJ at the beginning of June. The timing of the surgery makes Murphy a 2025 Fall League candidate, as he'll most likely be back very late this year, if at all. The 2026 season is Murphy's 40-man platform year, and it will be interesting to see how Atlanta handles his innings count and promotion pace once he returns. 
Murphy throws quality strikes with his fastball, which has vertical ride, helping it punch above its weight. His two breaking balls — an 81-85 mph slider and a slower 12-to-6 curveball — have lovely natural shape and break (especially the curveball), but both would benefit from more velocity (especially the slider). Though he doesn't really have a changeup right now, Murphy's athleticism and feel to pitch should enable growth in this area. Though Murphy has a silky smooth and repeatable delivery, it was tough to project on his velo while he was in high school because he had a boxy, relatively mature frame. If he can somehow pull a Walker Buehler, where he comes out of TJ rehab having added significant velocity, then he'll rocket through the minors upon his return. "
Jared Serna,2B,MIA,2026,,45+,High,22.8,50,55,50,60,"Serna is only listed at 5-foot-7, but he's long and sinewy, and he swings incredibly hard for such a small player. He also moves the barrel around the zone with uncommon feel for someone who swings with this much effort and verve. There's some chase-driven risk here. Serna is swing-happy in any count, but he gets especially antsy with two strikes, when he chases over 40% of the time. 
Serna's arm strength will likely limit him to second base at the highest levels. If his swing decisions prevent him from being an everyday second baseman, any kind of versatility would make Serna more rosterable as a utilityman; he's got quite a few left field reps in Mexico last winter but really only played the middle infield in 2024. The ferocity with which Serna swings gives him a puncher's chance to be an everyday second baseman, but he's more likely a Dylan Moore type of role player."
James Tibbs III,RF,SFG,2026,,45,Low,22.5,45,50,50,50,"Tibbs was a consistent three-year performer at Florida State, where he hit .338/.462/.685 throughout his career. He had a power leap as a junior, doubling his career home run total with 28 draft-year bombs; he also improved his K-to-BB ratio, with 58 walks and 37 strikeouts in 320 PA. Tibbs had one of the 2024 draft's higher floors as a lefty bat with a stable contact and power blend. Lightning quick hands allow him to snatch inner-half pitches to his pull side and generate oppo contact on pitches that travel deeper in the zone. There are times when Tibbs' swing looks like a dead ringer for Steven Kwan's, especially against down-and-away pitches; his mechanics once his swing ignites, as well as the way Tibbs uses the ground, are very similar to Kwan, though the Guardians' outfielder certainly isn't a comp for Tibbs' bat control or overall feel to hit. Tibbs is of medium build at a relatively maxed-out 6-feet tall. He doesn't produce monster peak exit velos, but he consistently hits the ball hard and in the air, which speaks to the verve in his hitting hands. He looks much less comfortable facing lefties, he has some trouble covering the up-and-away portion of the zone, and his contact rates after the draft were worse than what one might expect from one of the class' more stable college hitters. Much the same as prior to his selection, Tibbs looks like a good platoon outfielder with medium physical tools."
Nelson Rada,CF,LAA,2027,,45,Med,19.6,50,45,30,60,"The Angels floored Rada's promotion pace in 2024, and he began the season at Double-A Rocket City at just 18 years and seven months old. After being skipped over High-A entirely, his production predictably dipped; he slugged just .269 and had just 13 extra-base hits in 123 games. It is very difficult to contextualize Rada's offensive performance, and it's possible he was pushed in a way that was detrimental to his development, because he looked overmatched basically all year. He was basically a high schooler competing against pitchers who were, on average, about six years older than he was in 2024. 
Rada is a stocky 5-foot-8; his listed height dropped two inches after MLB's independent measurement last spring. He is not the typical 6-foot-1 teenager who you could see adding 20 or so pounds of muscle over time. It's important that the contact aspect of Rada's game ends up being a plus attribute because he probably won't develop big power. His strikeout rates have been climbing with each promotion, but again, it's fair to conclude his 2024 assignment was unreasonable and the root cause of this. Rada struggled to make contact with anything that wasn't in his natural bat path, and he swung over the top of a ton of breaking stuff and underneath many fastballs up and away from him. Improvement in this area will be key to him outpacing this updated, lower-variance fourth outfielder projection. 
Rada's defense is easily the most special and advanced part of his game. His range, routes, and balls skills all project to be plus if they aren't already. His poise and comfort out there is incredible for a player his age, and Rada's future defensive grade is only capped by his speed, which is ""merely"" plus and at risk of trending down because of how his build might progress. Rada is still a good prospect, but a lack of power projection caps his ceiling somewhat. Guys like Adam Eaton and Cedric Mullins provide examples of what it looks like when an outfielder this size succeeds in a big way despite a lack of physicality. It's still possible for Rada to get there, but it looks less likely now that he's encountered some hit tool instability."
George Lombard Jr.,SS,NYY,2027,,45,High,19.8,40,55,50,55,"Lombard entered last season as a Pick to Click. He showed exciting defense and bat-to-ball ability as an amateur, and it seemed plausible that once on a pro strength and conditioning program, he might also add meaningful power pretty quickly. Given his overall feel for the game, which was relatively polished for a high schooler, that could have led to a rapid ascent through the minors. Instead, Lombard had an uneven 2024 during which he whiffed at in-zone fastballs much more than was anticipated. Lombard's overall contact performance was just a shade below average, except for his performance inside the strike zone, which was <em>way</em> below the big league average. Driven largely by his on-base ability, Lombard was still able to produce an above-average batting line at Low-A Tampa and was promoted to Hudson Valley in August. Overall, he slashed .231/.338/.334 with a 23% strikeout rate. 
Lombard is still a pretty good shortstop defender who's adept at making throws on the run, no matter which direction he's moving. His arm stroke is a little long and atypical, and it takes considerable effort for him to throw hard, which can impact his accuracy. With hit tool risk creeping into his profile, it's become more important for Lombard to get strong and develop above-average power, something to carry his offensive profile. Until that starts to happen, he's projected here as more of a good utility infielder."
Jean Cabrera,SP,PHI,2026,,45,Med,23.4,,,,,"Cabrera took a huge step forward as a strike-thrower in 2023 and cut his walk rate in half compared to the year before. In 2024, he reinforced the notion that these improvements were real with a 7.4% walk rate and 3.39 FIP across 106.2 innings, culminating in a month at Reading. A lanky and athletic young righty with mid-90s arm strength and burgeoning changeup feel, Cabrera works in an even mix of his four pitches. He has distinct four- and two-seam fastballs (the way his sinker's movement interacts with his vertical arm slot seems to flummox hitters), and throws a ton of his firm, upper-80s one-seam sinker-style changeups in basically any count. He is definitely a control-over-command type of pitcher whose direct line to the plate allows him to throw plenty of strikes, though often without precision. This caps the effectiveness of Cabrera's slider, which tends to live on the plate rather than just off of it. There still isn't a plus pitch here, but the changeup is tracking like it will be one soon. After Cabrera was written up as a frame- and delivery-based sleeper on lists past, it's very exciting that he's made significant improvements in a couple of key areas and earned a 40-man spot. He now looks like a sinker-oriented no. 4/5 starter."
Adael Amador,2B,COL,2025,,45,Med,22,55,60,40,40,"I gave over-enthusiastic weight to Amador's small sample 2023 contact performance and rocketed him into the front half of the Top 100 prospects list. Then his 2024 season was a tale of two halves at Double-A Hartford: Amador slashed .194/.332/.313 before the All-Star break and .273/.357/.453 after. He made a brief 10-game big league cameo in June, more out of necessity than merit, and was never promoted to Triple-A Albuquerque, where he'll likely begin his second option year in 2025. 
The roller coaster ride that was Amador's 2024 season once again makes him a fairly difficult player to scout, though because of his improved health (a broken hamate in 2023 clouded his raw power eval) and a more robust data sample than the season before, the picture has become more clear. Amador's contact rates are great relative to other prospects (80% contact, 85% in-zone) but closer to average when you compare him to big league second basemen (80%, 87% respectively). This meshes with Amador's visual evaluation. He can move the barrel around the zone, he spoils a ton of well-located pitches, and his stocky, compact build allows him to have a short swing and pull the baseball as a left-handed hitter. A small percentage of Amador's lefty swings are ferocious, but for the most part, he utilizes a contact-oriented approach and generates below-average bat speed, which is even more the case when he bats righty. Despite this, Amador's hard-hit rate and peak exit velocities are also right around the big league average, which speaks to the quality of the contact he makes even with mediocre bat speed. Still, his splits against average or better fastball velocity aren't good, and that's something to monitor out of the gate in 2025 as precise, publicly available pitch data is generated at Triple-A parks in real time. In short, Amador is a roughly average all-around hitter for his position, with some indicators that suggest he'll trend down against better stuff. 
Even though he'll barely be 22 when the 2025 season begins, Amador's size limits his power projection; the cement on his bottom-heavy physique is mostly dry. There are many examples of physically generic second basemen who hit enough to be impact players for at least a little while (Adam Frazier, Brendan Donovan, Jeff McNeil, etc.), but all of them make (or made) elite rates of contact, not merely the 55- or 60-grade rates Adael has. 
Amador seems poised to be a second-division second base regular rather than an impact player, and it would make him much easier to roster if he finds a second viable defensive position, either third base or an outfield corner. He's entering his second option year, so it might behoove Colorado to experiment with one of those in 2025 — if not during the regular season, then definitely in the AFL or LIDOM."
Winston Santos,SP,TEX,2025,,45,Med,23,,,,,"Santos enjoyed a bat-missing boost across his entire repertoire last season, which was more average across the board in 2023 and but played above in 2024. He ran a 2.80 ERA at High-A Hickory during the first half of 2024 and was promoted to Frisco, where he continued to strike out 11/9 IP during the second half.
Santos' stuff isn't meaningfully different than in 2023. His fastball is still his best pitch, topping out at 98 mph with plus riding life. His secondary pitches are more frequently average than plus in terms of their pure nastiness, but Santos' command has begun to emerge as a potentially special aspect of his game and is elevating how they play. He's always thrown plenty of strikes (this is a very athletic 6-foot tall righty with a simple operation), but his release has grown more and more consistent, and Santos' stuff is more often in an enticing but unhittable location. His delivery is so effortless and easy that Santos looks like he'll sustain his velo across a starter's load of innings. He's already done so under a 100-inning load and threw a little more than that this season. Santos looks more likely to be parked at the back of a good rotation now and was added to the Rangers' 40-man roster after the season, making it likely that he plays a spot starter role next year. His long-term forecast is as a no. 4/5 starter right on the fringe of making a contender's playoff rotation."
Trey Yesavage,SP,TOR,2025,,45,Med,21.7,,,,,"Yesavage was an eastern Pennsylvania high schooler (Boyertown, James Develin and A.J. Bogucki's alma mater) who matriculated to ECU and carved. He ran a sub-3.00 ERA as a sophomore and junior, and had a top five ERA in college baseball last season. He also struck out 145 batters in 93.1 innings as a junior, a 17-inning increase from his prior season. It would have been more, but Yesavage dealt with a partially collapsed lung late in May. He was back for the college postseason, and while his fastball velocity was down slightly during his duel with Chase Burns (he averaged 92 mph rather than his usual 94), Yesavage looked fine and then flew to the Combine (which he couldn't have done without a healthy lung). 
Yesavage has a super vertical release point, nearly seven feet high at release, and is somewhat similar to Oliver Drake in that some of his breaking balls have arm-side action. He's able to command a mid-80s slider/cutter that looks and plays like either of those two pitches depending on the vertical location (the higher ones act as cutters, the lower ones sliders); he peppers the glove-side edge of the plate with them. His downhill mid-90s fastball has plus carry and misses bats in spite of its plane. It's a fastball/slider attack versus righties, with more splitters and slower breakers versus lefties. Yesavage's splitter command isn't as good as that of his fastball/slider, but the pitch has enough sink and velo separation to sometimes stay out of trouble when it isn't located well. Yesavage is a polished, quick-moving no. 4 starter type."
Tekoah Roby,MIRP,STL,2025,,40+,Med,23.5,,,,,"Roby was part of the Rangers' killer 2020 draft class and was really breaking out before a shoulder injury shelved him in early June of 2023. He was traded to the Cardinals as part of the Jordan Montgomery deal while he was on the IL and returned to action late in the year (including a Fall League stint), working with four plus-flashing pitches. Roby struggled in the early going of 2024 and then was shut down with yet another shoulder injury. When he returned late in the year, he pitched out of the bullpen and was working with less fastball velocity than before. At his best, Roby sits 94-97 mph with sink, bends in one of the nastier curveballs in the minors, tilts in a similarly shaped slider in the mid-80s, and turns over a tailing low-80s changeup. He was also throwing a cutter early last season, but that appears to have been shelved. Roby looked like he spent last offseason improving his conditioning, but his delivery is still quite violent and tough to repeat. Mechanical violence and inconsistency already led to a relief projection here, but the recurring injury and slip in velocity at the end of the year have caused Roby to slide out of the Top 100. He still has impact player projection, likely in a long relief role."
Diego Tornes,LF,ATL,2031,,45+,High,16.7,50,55,60,40,"Tornes is a big, switch-hitting power bat prospect with loud thump from the left side of the plate. One of the most exciting 2025 international amateurs, Tornes generates some Anthony Santander comps and signed for just under $2.5 million in January. 
Tornes' lefty swing requires little mechanical runway to generate lethal bat speed. His stride back towards the pitcher occupies a lot of the batter's box, but he doesn't use a big leg kick to get there. The strength and explosion in Tornes' hands is special and, unlike a lot of other hitters his size, it doesn't take an elaborate operation to generate. His right-handed swing isn't as explosive, and there are scouts who think he should just be hitting left-handed. If there's a nit to pick with this top-of-the-class talent, it's that Tornes' bat path isn't in the hitting zone for an especially long time. Tornes' conditioning also waxed and waned during the time between his verbal commitment and signing day, and he's likely a left field fit on defense long-term. He has the talent to hit his way into the middle of a big league order one day, and looks like the kind of high schooler who goes in the top half of the draft's first round."
James Triantos,2B,CHC,2026,,45,Med,22.2,70,70,35,50,"It's typical for contact prodigies like Triantos to be at least partially discovered because of their data — they rarely swing and miss during high school showcase play, and across several events, they generate a large enough sample to flag them because of this. In Triantos' case, the pandemic made it hard for him to accumulate such a sample, and yet the Cubs boldly gave him just over $2 million to sign as a second rounder rather than go to Virginia. Triantos has more or less run the minor league table as a plus or better contact hitter with all-fields doubles power. He's now reached Triple-A and sports a .289/.349/.417 career minor league line. He's been among the best pure contact hitters in the minors since he turned pro and has bounced around the 45-50 FV range the last couple of years as his defensive home has gotten sorted out. 
For a while he looked so rough at 2B/3B that he seemed destined for LF/DH, but the further and further Triantos has gotten from a 2023 meniscus injury, the better he has looked at second. He has below-average hands, but he's in his physical prime and as rangey and mobile as he's ever been, and should be able to play there. He has also been given reps in center field, and while he's a surprisingly fast runner given some of his other athletic limitations, the position is a stretch for him. We speculatively have left field as part of his future mix. Triantos doesn't have the power of a first division second baseman, so versatility should be part of his game; he can't handle the hot shots at third base, so left field it is.
Let's not lose sight of the apple here — Triantos can really hit. He has great bat control and his best swings have huge finish behind him, though he's definitely looser than he is explosive. Capable of pulling up-and-in pitches with power, Triantos is a line drive singles hitter in the bulk of the zone. He's a proactive swinger but isn't so chase prone that it threatens to sabatoge his overall production. The 2025 season will be Triantos' 40-man platform year. Whether he can play first base or left field might dictate whether he's easy to roster or necessary to trade."
Marco Raya,MIRP,MIN,2025,,45,Med,22.6,,,,,"Raya still has the look of a no. 4/5 starter, but the restrictor plates haven't been taken off of his innings load and we don't know for sure if he can fill that role under the stress of a big league starter's workload; he is still only going three or four innings at a time. Raya has a lean, slight frame with limited strength at present, a very compact arm circle, and a high arm slot. He’s coming off a 2023 season that covered 62.2 innings between Cedar Rapids and Wichita, striking out 25.3% of batters and posting a 4.02 ERA overall as a 20-year-old. He's on pace to work about 85 innings in 2024, going three or four innings per start with six days of rest in between. 
Raya's fastball is sitting 94-96 mph, but he’s struggled mightily to generate whiffs in the zone with it against Double-A hitters; some of that seems to be because there’s a lack of deception in his delivery, which looks easy to time. His mid-to-upper-80s slider projects to plus with its sharp two-plane and downer shapes; it has had no issues missing bats, especially against righties. The changeup, with it’s limited action and velocity separation (87-90 mph), continues to lag behind the rest of Raya's arsenal, but he’s added a cutter this year to go along with his vertical curveball to better combat left-handers. The curveball is a deep 12-to-6 breaker that shows above-average tightness and, at 80-84 mph, offers a significant separation in pace from his fastball. Raya’s new cutter is short but quick, and will serve as a pitch to stay off barrels rather than completely miss them. This is Raya's 40-man platform year and we officially have him on the starter/reliever line until we see him stretched out more than he has been so far."
Gino Groover,3B,ARI,2026,,45,Med,23,50,55,45,55,"Groover spent his freshman season at UNC Wilmington (Nate Furman, David McCabe, and Jake Cunningham were teammates) before transferring to NC State, where he raked for two years (259 total bases in 114 career games) and became one of the more interesting prospects in the 2023 draft. Groover's prospect case was very strong on paper (he had a rare blend of high-end contact rates and measurable power) but was spottier in more subjective, visual ways (he was a mistake-prone third base defender with kind of a weird swing, but rare hand speed). Groover entered 2024 as a Pick to Click, but he never really got the chance to, as he fractured his wrist in a collision with a baserunner during the first week of the season and missed several months. He returned in late July, hit well for a little over a month at High-A Hillsboro, and finished his year with a couple weeks at Amarillo and then the Arizona Fall League. 
After 88 career minor league games, Groover is hitting .281/.362/.450 with a 10% career strikeout rate. He is short to the baseball and most dangerous against pitches on the inner third of the plate, which he can pull with authority. His style of hitting might leave him vulnerable to better breaking balls on the outer half, but so far Groover has been able to spoil these pitches. His measured power was unimpressive in 2024, but he was coming off a wrist fracture, so it's fine to mostly ignore this. Matt Vierling presents a pretty good comp for the way Groover both swings and is projected to produce on offense. 
Like Vierling, Groover is a native third baseman who has not always looked capable of playing there, and he began branching out on defense in 2024 with reps at both first base (where he got hurt, and then didn't play again until the Fall League) and the keystone. Groover has improved at third and is getting rid of the baseball quicker on the subset of plays he has historically struggled to make cleanly. Rather than airmail some tough throws, he's throwing accurate one- and two-hoppers over there as quickly as he can, and it's working. It looks like Groover's going to be capable of playing all three spots, while also crushing lefties and matching up well against righties whose stuff tends to live in his happy zone. He projects as a complementary regular who gets 400 or so annual plate appearances at multiple positions."
Trevor McDonald,SP,SFG,2025,,45,Low,24.1,,,,,"Though McDonald has had trouble staying on the field and has worked 100 or more innings in just one of his four full pro seasons, he has still been successfully developed as a starter and made his big league debut at the very end of 2024. McDonald's injuries have run the gamut. An AC joint sprain and bad hamstring interrupted his 2023, while a tweaked groin delayed the start of his 2024. As 2024 dragged on, McDonald's per-outing workload grew, and by the end of the season he was working as many as six innings at a time, totaling 89 frames on the year. T-Mac retained his usual velocity as he stretched out and successfully dealt with Triple-A (10 outings, 47.2 IP, 4.72 ERA, 1.26 WHIP, 51.7% groundballs). 
McDonald's delivery is a tad funky, in part because his arm action is so deliberately short, but he has an exceptionally powerful lower body that allows him to get way down the mound; he's a short-levered 6-foot-2, but generates just over six and a half feet of extension. His curt, Jason Adam-style arm stroke is very consistent, and he has had no issues with strike-throwing in pro ball. He has also developed a starter's repertoire. McDonald's fastball has heavy sink when he locates it near the bottom of the zone, while at the top of the zone it has a funky tailing action and flat angle. He crowds righties' hands with the tailing version, and then freezes them with an 85-mph slider that starts at their knuckles and finishes in the zone. Against lefties, McDonald tries to live on the outer half with everything he's got, including an upper-80s changeup. McDonald is one of several good, young Giants 40-man arms who have two (in McDonald's case) or three option years left, and will serve as spot starters and swingmen in 2025. Over time, McDonald should establish himself as a grounder-getting no. 4/5 starter."
J.T. Ginn,SP,ATH,2025,,45,Low,25.9,,,,,"Ginn, who has had a litany of arm issues throughout his career, looked healthy for the first time in a while during the 2024 season, when he exceeded 100 innings for the first time in his career and reached the big leagues. Ginn had Tommy John surgery just before the shutdown in 2020, though that didn't deter the Mets from selecting him in the second round of that year’s draft. He was traded to Oakland for Chris Bassitt before the 2022 season. Forearm soreness cost him a chunk of that season, and he showed reduced velocity and poor command upon his return, only to be shut down two more times in quick succession with forearm soreness last year. Early on in 2024, Ginn was more often in the 92-95 mph range and his command rebounded. 
Ginn has a drop-and-drive delivery and a vertical arm slot, but he tends to work with sink and not ride, atypical of a delivery like his. The sink on Ginn's fastball is really nasty, so even though it has below-average velocity, it's at least an average pich. The balance and consistency of his delivery allow him to fill the zone, and his sinker pairs nicely with his slider, which generated a 17% swinging strike rate during his eight-game big league run in 2024. Ginn's changeup feel should improve as he continues to pitch, and the same could be true of the mid-90s velocity we saw glimpses of early in 2024. This is a stable no. 4/5 sinker/slider starter."
Sam Aldegheri,SP,LAA,2025,,45,Low,23.6,,,,,"Aldegheri is a crafty Italian lefty who signed with Philly for $210,000 back in 2019. He had been tracking as a spot starter, but in 2024, his secondary stuff took a leap; he raced through the minors and became part of the Angels' return from the Phils for Carlos Estévez. Across 95.1 innings split between the minors and majors, Aldegheri struckout 134 guys and threw strikes at a better-than-average rate until near the end of the season. 
Aldegheri only sits 90-94, but he creates plus riding life (18 inches of induced vertical break on average) from a deceptive vertical slot. He has that classic, short-levered vertical lefty arm stroke in the Clayton Kershaw mold, the kind that prevents hitters from seeing the baseball until it appears from behind the pitcher's head. Off of that Aldegheri mixes in a plus low-80s slider and an improving changeup, both of which he commands to effective locations. He'll dump in a slower curveball for called strikes on occasion. He probably won't be a monster due to a lack of velocity, but Aldegheri is a high-floored no. 4/5 starter and a fantastic story because he's coming from a place that has rarely produced pro baseball players."
Cam Schlittler,SP,NYY,2026,,45,Med,24.2,,,,,"Schlittler is an XXL, fastball-heavy starter who had a fantastic 2024 season in which he led the Yankees org in strikeouts. Schlittler worked 120.2 innings, K'd 29.8% of opponents, and generated a 51.2% groundball rate while reaching Double-A toward the end of the year. His size and arm angle create downhill plane on his mid-90s fastball akin to a runaway truck ramp, while the backspinning nature of the pitch also creates riding life that, combined with the plane, disorients hitters. Schlittler's fastball lives right at the top of the strike zone, garnered strikes at 70% clip in 2024, and peaked at 98 mph. Off of that pitch Schlittler bends in a couple of different breaking balls. He has a low-80s curveball that drops into the top of the zone, a two-planed mid-80s slider, and an upper-80s cutter. The sliders and cutters are heavily used against righties, while the curveball is more of an arm-side weapon against lefties. These pitches are more average or a shade below, though all of Schlittler's component parts fit together nicely to keep hitters off balance. 
Schlittler is a below-average athlete whose style of pitching is somewhat inefficient. He looks like a lock to be put on the Yankees' 40-man roster either toward the end of the 2024 season or after its conclusion, and should be in the mix for starts toward the back of the rotation starting in 2026."
Eduardo Tait,C,PHI,2029,,45,High,18.6,40,40,55,30,"Tait (pronounced with two syllables, Tah-eet) was part of Panama's U18 World Cup team in the fall of 2022, only about six weeks after he turned 16. He signed with the Phillies the following January and was the youngest player in the organization throughout the 2023 season, during which he hit an amazing .333/.400/.517 in the DSL. Tait followed that up with a .302/.356/.486 line in 2024, split between the complex and Clearwater, and turned 18 near the end of the season. 
Tait swings with bad intentions, selling out for pull power with enormous effort. He already has average big league raw power, which is very exciting for a hitter his age, even more so when you consider he's a lefty-hitting catcher. He's performed well in spite of a semi-concerning lack of plate discipline. In addition to his indulgent, expansive approach, Tait can struggle to get on top of fastballs up and away from him. He's likely to have a flawed offensive skill set exposed as he climbs the minors, but so long as Tait keeps getting to power and developing behind the dish, that's going to be okay. His leap from his first pro season to his second was encouraging in this regard. Tait is still not a good defender, but he's much better than the year before. He has good raw arm strength but takes too long to exit his crouch, and his ball-blocking needs to take better advantage of his size instead of relying on his hands all the time. It's not a bad spot for a teenage catcher to be. Tait's talent and FV grade are on par with a mid-to-late first round high school draft prospect. Like all teenage catchers, he's risky and likely to take a while to develop."
Yanquiel Fernandez,RF,COL,2025,,45,High,22.2,40,40,55,30,"Fernandez's prodigious left-handed power and very exciting long-term frame projection made him a need-to-know prospect while he was still in rookie ball. But as he has accrued more and more pro reps and generated more data, a crack has emerged in his profile: a lack of plate discipline. Even as Fernandez has enjoyed sensational surface-level performance (148 wRC+ and 17 homers in the first half of 2023, 120 wRC+ as a 21-year-old at Double-A Hartford in 2024), he has some concerning underlying indicators in his chase rates (38% chase, 57% chase with two strikes) and a visible issue with high-and-away fastballs that could become more problematic against big league stuff. Fernandez's swing generates some epic homers, but he's vulnerable to both whiffs and weak contact when pitchers execute to the outer third of the zone against him. Because Fernandez is a heavy-footed corner guy, he needs to rake to be an impact player, but each of these issues is potentially a real problem for his future offensive output. Jesús Sánchez (who has been okay, more talented than productive) and Oscar Colás (who has really struggled) illustrate the effects of these issues. 
After struggling down the stretch at Triple-A toward the end of 2024, Fernandez went to the Puerto Rican Winter League and continued to flounder. He is still just 22 and has rare left-handed power; he's a good prospect but an incredibly risky one despite his precocious mid-minors success. He should get to enough power versus righties to be a good platoon guy."
Moises Ballesteros,C,CHC,2026,,45,Med,21.4,50,50,50,20,"Ballesteros is a husky catcher who signed for $1.2 million back in 2021 as a bat-first prospect who needed substantial development as a defender. He's raked as he's climbed the minors (he's posted a .279/.366/.452 career line and has reached Triple-A), and though he still isn't an ironclad catching defender, Ballesteros has improved enough back there to maintain projection at the position. 
Ballesteros' best defensive attribute is his arm accuracy. He doesn't have an all-world hose, but he has a surprisingly quick release for a guy his size and throws a lot of accurate one-hoppers to second in the 1.95-2.00 second range, sometimes from his knees. His receiving has improved to a place of viability, but his ball-blocking, especially to his left, mostly has not. Though this problem was much more pronounced during the 2024 Arizona Fall League than it was during the regular season, it's an issue that might prevent him from catching pitchers whose stuff is apt to expose his issues, and in his particular case that means guys whose stuff tends to finish in the dirt. 
Were Ballesteros more of a lock to catch, then he'd have a great argument to be in the Top 100 because he pretty comfortably hits enough to profile as a primary catcher. As a part-time first baseman or DH, though, he falls a tad short — literally. At just 5-foot-8 and built like Alejandro Kirk, Ballesteros lacks the typical physicality and power of a big league 1B/DH. He has roughly average raw power and zero physical projection; his body is maxed out and it'd be surprising if he got much stronger even though he's still only 21. While Ballesteros is a good all-fields contact hitter and great at making inflight adjustments to breaking stuff, he has become more and more chase prone against high fastballs as he's climbed the minors. His 36% chase rate against fastballs is way above what's typical for hitters generally, let alone against fastballs that tend to have lower chase rates than pitch types more often meant to make hitters go fishing. His chase against other pitch types is more typical. 
This forecast for Ballesteros rounds down on his offense a bit more than last list cycle, and puts him in more of an average contact and power territory with potentially below-average on base skills looming as he faces more and more quality fastballs. Combine that with a potentially short timeline of athletic viability, and Ballesteros looks more like a solid part-time player who catches once a week and gets a couple starts against righties, which should still allow him to amass 300-400 annual plate appearances of roughly average offense. The 2025 season is Ballesteros' 40-man platform year, and the Cubs have acquired veteran catching that now slides him down the current catching depth chart. If he can improve as a defender, then perhaps he'll be the Cubs' best option behind the dish at some point in 2025, but for now he looks more likely to debut in 2026."
Demetrio Crisantes,2B,ARI,2028,,45,Low,20.6,55,55,40,40,"Crisantes was the star infielder at Nogales High School, a powerhouse program in Arizona that went to the state finals twice during Crisantes' tenure. Since entering pro ball, he has been a superlative statistical performer at the lowest domestic levels. Crisantes hit his way off the complex in 2024 and slashed .333/.429/.478 across 63 games at Low-A Visalia. He also had 23 extra-base hits, a strong strikeout-to-walk ratio, and was 20-for-22 on stolen base attempts. 
Crisantes does a lot of little things really well, but he isn't especially toolsy or projectable. He's a fantastic defensive second baseman who plays with a low center of gravity, and he has plus hands and actions. He's also seen time at both corner infield spots, but he has less arm strength than is ideal for third base. Visual evaluation of Crisantes' hit tool comes in south of his data, which is plus. Though his bat path doesn't look like it will be on time against upper-level velocity, he had an 89% in-zone contact rate in 2024 and his swing is geared for loft in an awful lot of the zone for a guy making that much contact. He may not have the offensive output of an impact everyday hitter but should be a core role player who sees 400 PA or so on the right side of the infield."
Mason Barnett,SP,ATH,2026,,45,Med,24.4,,,,,"Barnett moved into Auburn's rotation in the middle of his junior season and his stuff peaked late in the year as the draft approached. The violence and inconsistency of his delivery caused him to project as a reliever on our draft rankings, but he's been developed as a starter so far and has outperformed that pre-draft expectation through Double-A, where he pitched 133 combined innings between the Royals and Athletics orgs in 2024 (he was part of the Lucas Erceg trade). Barnett struck out 28.5% of the Texas League hitters he faced while walking them at just a 8.7% clip.
The barrel chested right-hander has a fastball that sits in the mid-90s with uphill angle through the zone, as well as a 84-87 mph slider that routinely flashes plus with its two-plane action. Barnett also has a curveball in his mix that has significant depth and is vertical in nature, but it rarely shows the explosiveness in its break that his slider does; it's more often a pitch he wants to land in the zone for strikes. He maintains his arm speed and delivery enough to help his changeup play despite its lack of movement, and because of that, it’s an offering that will likely develop into at least an average pitch for him even if it doesn't generate big swing-and-miss numbers. Barnett continues to perform well as a starter and his strong build looks fit for a back-of-the-rotation role as a good team's no. 4/5 starter."
Elmer Rodriguez-Cruz,SP,NYY,2026,,45,Med,21.6,,,,,"The Yankees have a ton of upper-level catching depth while the Red Sox are quite thin there, so the two clubs made a deal during the Winter Meetings that sent reserve catcher Carlos Narvaez to Boston in exchange for Rodriguez-Cruz. ERC was still shy of 18 when Boston picked him in the fourth round of the 2021 draft out of Leadership Christian Academy, the Puerto Rican high school that also boasts Heliot Ramos and Jose Miranda as alums. He signed for just shy of $500,000 rather than go to Oregon. He didn't have electric stuff coming out of high school, but he did have a prototypical 6-foot-3 starter's build, a smooth delivery, and a shapely breaking ball, allowing you to dream on his velocity, command, and changeup growth. 
For the last couple of seasons, Rodriguez-Cruz has been on an upward trajectory in terms of his velocity and innings count. He rather impressively held his own as a teenage starter in full-season ball in 2023 before he was shut down with elbow inflammation. At the time, Elmer was sitting 92 and mixing in three secondary offerings. Then in 2024, he experienced a significant velo jump while also adding a cutter. Rodriguez-Cruz sat 95, touched 98, and maintained starter-quality walk rates during the first half of the season before he regressed and became walk-prone starting in July.
This is a bullish evaluation of Rodriguez-Cruz, who feels like he'd be in the late first round mix were he a college junior.  Basically everything you could have hoped for when ERC was drafted has either happened or begun to. He's parlayed his curveball feel into two other promising breaking balls — he has a mid-80s slider and a cutter that tops out around 89 mph — and he continues to have changeup (or maybe splitter) projection because of his loose, whippy arm action. There isn't a dominant offering among them, but everything is average with a shot to mature above. The dip in strikes late last year feels natural considering ERC had blown through his previous career-high innings total and was also throwing harder than ever before. He's still awfully skinny and will hopefully get stronger as a means of adding stamina; the Yankees have been good at helping their athletes do that. This is a sleeper Top 100 candidate for next year if Rodriguez-Cruz can sustain his 2024 stuff with another 20 or so innings added to his ledger in 2025, his 40-man platform year."
Hurston Waldrep,SP,ATL,2025,,45,Med,23.1,,,,,"Waldrep barely pitched as a freshman at Southern Miss but somehow managed the stamina to strike out 140 hitters in 90 innings as a sophomore. He transferred to Florida for his junior year and had a nearly identical season, this time blowing away SEC hitters for most of the spring. He ranked sixth on my 2023 draft board, but fell to Atlanta at no. 24 overall due to his perceived relief risk and the quality of the rest of the class. 
Waldrep began his first full pro season in Double-A, dominated in May and early June, and was promoted to the big leagues less than a year after he was drafted. After two rocky big league starts, he was shut down with elbow inflammation, and it took two months before Waldrep was back to working five innings or more per outing again. He looked normal at the very end of the season, reaching back for 97-98 early in outings before backing down into the 93-96 range late. 
Waldrep's approach to pitching is such that he likely won't work efficiently as a starter if he can stick in a rotation. He often has to work above the zone with his fastball for it to be effective, and he runs deep counts because of this. The headline pitch in his arsenal is a cartoonish split changeup, which has incredible fading action and has missed bats at an elite rate in pro ball. The lone thing stopping this offering from receiving an 80 grade is Waldrep's tendency to leave it hanging, though often it's nasty enough to avoid damage even when he does. His curveball has taken a back seat in pro ball, and he has instead made use of a 84-89 mph cutter/slider, which is about average. His ability to routinely land that pitch for a strike contributes to Waldrep's starter projection here. Waldrep is similar to Reese Olson and Drey Jameson, on the starter reliever line but likely to be a good member of a big league staff in some capacity. The lack of fastball playability likely ushers him to the bullpen, or at least will limit his innings-eating ability enough to have slid Waldrep just outside the Top 100."
Brandon Young,SP,BAL,2025,,45,Med,26.6,,,,,"An undrafted senior from 2020, Young had a great 2021 debut season, striking out a third of the A-ball hitters he faced while working about four innings per start. He was assigned to Double-A Bowie in 2022 and made just three starts there before he was shut down with elbow tendinitis, which led to a Tommy John surgery that kept him out until mid-July 2023 (Young also had a surgery in 2014). His fastball sat 91 mph across 40 innings during the second half of 2023, but Young enjoyed a two-tick leap in 2024 without sacrificing any command. That has had a multiplicative effect on the pitch's quality thanks to Young's underlying fastball traits; he was utterly dominant at Double-A Bowie early in 2024 and quickly promoted to Norfolk. 
Young doesn't light up the radar gun, but his fastball's movement and angle helps it punch above its weight and pairs nicely with his vertical mid-70s curveball. It's pretty rare for a breaking ball that slow to be impact offerings in the modern game, but Young's has plus-plus spin and his size helps keep it from popping out of his hand in an identifiable way. Those two pitches are plus offerings for Young, who also has plus command. His ability to spin the ball should allow his cutter to improve over time, while he can also throw strikes with a changeup that often catches too much of the strike zone. This is an older mid-rotation starter prospect who has gotten better as he's gotten further from his second TJ. He's now nearly proven he can sustain this level of performance against upper-level hitters and across a starter's workload of innings, so this is a somewhat speculative addition to the 50 FV tier, but Young has fastball playability and command and those guys tend to pan out."
Carson Palmquist,SP,COL,2026,,45,Low,24.4,,,,,"Palmquist's arm slot has come up a lot since college and, though still low, it now looks much more like a lot of other starters' arm strokes. Palmquist has also gotten much stronger since entering pro ball, and has now performed across a 27-start, 117.2-inning load, including success at hitter-friendly Hartford. Palmquist has retained enough of his Clay Rapada-like funk to remain deceptive, allowing his 91-mph fastball to punch above its weight. He mixes breaking ball shapes and speeds across a wide range of velos, most of them in the upper 70s. Palmquist's slower breaking balls are the ones with his best swing-and-miss rates. These are sweepers in the 74-75 mph range, and likely will be less effective against big leaguers. Conversely, Palmquist's changeup should have meaningful long-term growth as he gets more comfortable with this newer delivery; he also has the arm action and athleticism combo you want in order to forecast changeup growth. Palmquist lacks the pinpoint command one would need to be an impact starter with average stuff, but he's poised to be a consistent no. 4/5 starter soon by virtue of his repertoire depth and deception."
Carson Seymour,MIRP,SFG,2025,,40+,Med,26.3,,,,,"Acquired as part of the return package for Darin Ruf, Seymour is a profoundly interesting righty with a plus-plus slider. Seymour is an XL 6-foot-6, but his arm is incredibly whippy and loose. He generates mid-90s sinkers that have a tendency to find barrels more than they miss bats. His cutter/slider is a lethal 86-90 mph two-plane weapon with incredibly late bite. Its sudden, jarring movement helped generate a miss rate north of 40% in 2024. Seymour has been developed as a starter thus far. On the surface he lacks platoon-neutralizing weapons, but his sinker runs off the front hip of lefties and back over the plate with surprising regularity. There's enough sink on his fastball to have generated groundball rates north of 50% throughout his minor league career. It helps Seymour operate somewhat more efficiently than he does from a pure strike-throwing standpoint. He lacks the repertoire depth of a typical starter but has nasty, unique looking stuff that should allow him to play a very effective long relief role."
Samy Natera Jr.,SIRP,LAA,2027,,40+,High,25.4,,,,,"Born in Mexico, Natera went to high school in El Paso. He was mostly focused on basketball in high school and didn't start pitching until he was 17 years old. He had a walk-prone pro debut in 2023 and then sprained his elbow during 2024 spring training, which limited him to 15 innings during the regular season. Natera then had a great Arizona Fall League showing, as he would routinely peak in the 95-97 mph range during his starts while sitting 93-94 for the bulk of his outings. He was in as good of physical condition as any Fall Leaguer save for maybe Jac Caglianone, with a sculpted 6-foot-4 frame that looks like it can handle a starter's innings load. Natera's delivery has a long arm swing and his release is inconsistent, but his fastball's shape gives him some margin for error in this regard and he simply has not pitched very much for someone his age. He has an above-average sweeper in the 81-85 mph range and can create modest fade on his low-80s changeup. Every aspect of Natera's craftsmanship could conceivably improve. This is an athletic guy without a ton of high-level experience who, if his physique is any indication, seems motivated to max himself out. He's a multi-inning relief prospect with some right tail outcomes in a rotation if indeed he is just scratching the surface."
Aroon Escobar,2B,PHI,2028,,40+,Med,20.2,55,60,50,50,"Escobar is a burly, versatile infield prospect with a contact-driven profile and (in a small sample) measurable power that suggests he has a shot to break out in profound way in 2025. 
Escobar has been brought along a little more slowly than is typical for someone as physically mature as he is. He's listed at 180 pounds, but is probably closer to 215 and would be at home in an SEC football team's locker room. He probably would have been promoted to Clearwater at some point in 2024 had he not been shut down with shin splints in early-June. Escobar slashed a BABIP-aided .338/.495/.481 during that span, but his underlying data is eye-popping; he had an 80% contact rate and 48% hard-hit rate. Those are the contact stats of an everyday player, but 104 plate appearances isn't enough to be confident that Escobar's true talent is on that level. He has a multi-year track record when it comes to the contact component, but the power aspect is new. That said, Escobar has lively hitting hands that are short and direct to the ball, making him very difficult to beat in the strike zone. He lacks anything close to typical projection for a 20-year-old hitter because he's already so muscular, but unlike a lot of bulky athletes, he's a loose and explosive rotator in his hips. 
After Aidan Miller and Eduardo Tait, it's Escobar who has the best chance to develop an everyday player's offensive skill set. It's harder to nail down his defensive forecast. Escobar's mobility may have been altered by his injury, and the presence of Starlyn Caba on the complex relegated him to second and third base. Getting a better feel for Escobar's defensive ability and long-term fit will be a big part of his 2025 season, which hopefully begins in full-season ball and will include a mid-season promotion to Lakewood if he keeps hitting like this."
Brayden Taylor,3B,TBR,2026,,45+,Low,22.9,35,30,55,50,"Taylor had swing-and-miss issues exposed during his draft year even though he hit a career-best 23 homers and ended his tenure at TCU having slashed .315/.442/.595. In 108 PA after the draft, he struck out 31.5% of the time but still slugged .516 by virtue of how aggressive his swing's uppercut path tends to be. Taylor had a very similar 2024, as he opened the season at High-A Bowling Green and ended it with six weeks at Montgomery. Combined, he slashed .250/.365/.493 and clubbed 20 homers, cutting his strikeouts at High-A (24.8%) before they spiked to a scary area (36.8%) after he was promoted. 
Taylor is extremely lift- and pull-oriented. He averaged 24 degrees of launch last year; Daulton Varsho was the lone qualified big leaguer with a mark that high in 2024. His hips tend to bail toward first base as he swings, creating a hole on the outer third of the zone, while the manner in which Taylor's swing is geared for lift results in a second hole at the top of the zone. Still, Taylor's combination of lift and selectivity should allow him to hit for a decent amount of power even though he has slightly below-average raw power right now, and it's plausible the baby-faced Taylor as more juice in the way. 
The Rays have tried to move Taylor up the defensive spectrum, giving him a lot of middle infield reps rather than playing him exclusively at his native third base, and it just might work. His hands and actions are of shortstop quality, his arm accuracy is more on the fringe. He's a 45-grade shortstop, plus third base defender, and should be plus at second base with time. The ceiling for Taylor is akin to a lefty-hitting Paul DeJong, where he's getting to power and playing an okay shortstop. There may also be some leaner, strikeout-prone years betwixt and between more productive ones, but even in those, Taylor will still produce like a good-gloved utility guy. "
Zyhir Hope,LF,LAD,2028,,45+,High,18.8,40,35,60,60,"Hope was traded to the Dodgers as part of the Michael Busch deal before 2024 spring training, just six months after he was selected as the Cubs’ 2023 11th-round pick. He then missed most of the first half of the 2024 season with a shoulder injury and was limited to just 61 regular season games before he picked up reps in the Arizona Fall League. He slashed .287/.415/.490 in 248 PA at Rancho Cucamonga and then .228/.301/.446 in 103 PA in Arizona. Hope has enormous all-fields power and incredible speed for an athlete his size, but his Low-A and AFL strikeouts (25% K%), combined with his poor defensive feel, create risk that Hope is a strikeout-prone LF/DH. 
Hope was a speed-oriented high school prospect but has become tremendously strong since turning pro, and he's able to generate big power in a short mechanical distance. His 2024 peak exit velocities were comfortably plus on the big league scale; during Fall League, I watched him hit a 470-foot homer one day and then fight off a 97 mph fastball for an oppo homer the next. I believe there is still volatile hit tool risk here. Hope's head is often flying all over the place when he swings, and you can get him out if you execute to the top of the strike zone. Though his underlying regular season contact data in 2024 was quite positive, it was generated in less than half a season of Low-A plate appearances, and against the Cal League pitchers who weren't promoted to High-A for the second half. I'm not inclined to take it at face value, and instead want to lean on my eyes, which are telling me there's K risk here. Hope's feel for defense is also not good right now. It's possible this is simply due to a lack of pro reps, but if it remains this way then Hope will be a below-average LF, or a DH. His added size has given him tremendous power, Hope's lower body has grown like the Grinch's heart during the last twelve-plus months and he's still very fast for an athlete his size, but it's tough to predict how Hope's mobility will trend into his mid-20s when he's already this big at this age.
Hope's power is so big, that if he can maintain even a 25-28% K%, he'll get to enough pop to be good no matter what he's doing on defense. A Kyle Schwarber-y outcome like that is possible here. Currently sitting just outside the Top 100, Hope has just about half a season of A-ball plate appearances to his name and is likely to be a bottom-of-the-spectrum defender, so let's see if can sustain a viable level of contact against mid-minors pitching in a full season before declaring him a middle-of-the-order lock."
Bryce Rainer,SS,DET,2028,,45+,High,19.7,40,40,55,55,"Rainer pitched and played all over the field with high school Team USA, and he was generally seen as pitching prospect until things began to shift in the fall and winter of 2023, when he was suddenly hitting for big power against good varsity prep pitching. He reinforced notions that he had ascended into the middle of the first round as a hitter at 2024 NHSI, and moved up to 10th on the FanGraphs Draft Board. He was drafted 11th overall and got $5.8 million to sign, but he didn't play after the draft.
Rainer has a huge arm, which he showed off at various positions with Team USA (including first base), and this roaming is probably part of why it took him longer to really break out. Rainer sits in the mid-90s on the mound, and has a 70-grade infield arm and an 80-grade arm when he crow hops throws from the outfield. As he's gotten stronger, Rainer has gotten faster, and he still has the footspeed to play short even as he's grown into meaningful power. Rainer's low-ball swing is vulnerable to velocity up and away from him in a significant way, and he had a sub-70% contact rate on the showcase circuit in a nearly 500-pitch sample. He shows very little barrel variability, though he can alter the timing of his footwork to match the pitch type, and his swing has natural loft. He was a Top 100 exclusion as we wait to see how he handles pro-quality pitching. Lefty-hitting shortstops with power like Rainer is likely to have are rare, and he has the upside of an impact, All-Star-level player if it turns out he can actually hit."
Owen Caissie,RF,CHC,2025,,45,Med,22.7,35,30,60,30,"A Canadian outfielder originally drafted by the Padres and traded to the Cubs for Yu Darvish, Caissie's power output exploded in 2023 and held firm in 2024 even though his underlying power data backed up quite a bit. He still generated plus raw pop, but Caissie's peak exit velocities were below the elite numbers he posted in 2023. It's important for Caissie to get to big power because he has other limitations as a hitter. For instance, he is very vulnerable to fastballs located at the top of the zone. His contact rates are near the bottom of what is usually acceptable from a good big league corner outfielder. With elite power, that's okay. With plus power, Caissie looks more like a platoon option that an everyday cleanup hitter. He's still just 22 and Caissie has long been the sort of prospect who could break late; he's a cold weather guy and didn't play baseball under lights at night until he turned pro. This grade pulls him back to the lefty platoon role, but leaves room for him to reclaim the power-hitting clout from last year."
Adriel Radney,CF,ARI,2030,,45,High,17.8,50,50,50,55,"Radney, who signed for $1.85 million, has a non-zero chance of maturing in the Goldilocks Zone as an athlete who retains the speed to play center field while also developing big power. He was viewed as one of the few prospects from the 2024 IFA class with a chance to do at least a little bit of everything (and a lot of some things), and he was also one of the youngest. He played 34 games between both of Arizona’s DSL clubs and slashed .225/.331/.288 with 25 strikeouts (19.2%) and 14 walks (10.8%) over 130 plate appearances. More notably, Radney didn’t produce a single homer over the summer and only had five extra base hits total. He was dealing with a back issue all summer, which may have limited his output on both sides of the ball (he didn't play center field in 2024). 
Radney still showcases impressive bat speed, but his downward path creates issues getting the ball off of the ground (53% groundball rate last year). He's going to repeat the DSL in 2025. We still love the athleticism, projection, and bat speed here and think it's encouraging that Radney didn't strike out a ton even though he was apparently compromised. Before he signed, Radney was evaluated like a draft's top 10 pick; now he's graded as if he's more of a late first rounder as we wait to see if his debut was an injury-influenced blip or not."
Steven Echavarria,SP,ATH,2028,,45,High,19.6,,,,,"This lanky righty from Jersey had a velo spike during his senior spring, and after sitting 90-93 mph during his pre-draft summer, he was touching 95-96 en route to state Player of the Year as a senior. Even though aspects of his fastball plane and shape were clearly suboptimal, Echavarria's breaking ball quality made him one of the more exciting high school pitchers in the 2023 draft, and he signed for $3 million rather than go to Florida. He pitched during 2023 instructs (that's where the linked video is from) and in 2024 extended spring training before making his affiliate debut at Stockton. Echavarria then tossed 57.2 frames as an 18-year-old in the Cal League, where he struck out 21% of batters he faced while also walking them at a 13% clip. His fastball was back in the 90-94 range but, because of his frame's projectability, there’s very likely to be more velocity as he continues to add strength in the coming years. 
Echavarria's breaking ball is nasty. His arm slot makes it so that pitch is only ever descending; it doesn't float up out of his hand in an identifiable way. Last year, it was a plus curveball in the upper-70s; in 2024, it had more of a slider look in the 84-86 mph range. He does a good job of maintaining his fastball arm speed when throwing his changeup, but Echavarria's feel for locating it is a work in progress. His fastball strikes are also inconsistent, and sometimes he spins on the heel of his front foot as it catches his motion and loses his line to the plate. It's pretty typical for pitchers with levers this long to scatter their fastballs at this age, and Echavarria's control is fine enough and his delivery smooth enough to project him as a starter. Echavarria’s 2024 stat line doesn't jump off the page, but his ability to hold his own at that level as an 18-year-old while flashing the caliber of stuff he did definitely constitutes a productive first season in his professional development process. We'd like to see him maintain the mid-90s heat he has shown in short bursts across a whole season. He's still quite a long way from having proven he can do that, but there's a mid-rotation future here if he can."
Edgleen Perez,C,NYY,2028,,45,High,18.8,50,50,45,40,"Perez holds serve in this FV tier after another outstanding year, this time on the Florida complex roster. Perez is a medium-framed, relatively mature, twitchy catching athlete with a quickdraw release and advanced bat-to-ball skills. He has the hands and lateral quickness to develop into a good receiver and ball-blocker over time, and he has impact arm strength. He looked fine catching rehabbers on the complex, who tended to have much better stuff than most rookie ball pitchers. 
Perez also looks a good bit bigger and stronger than his official height and weight (5-foot-10, 155 pounds) suggests. He doesn't have prototypical impact catcher size like an Adley Rutschman or Salvador Perez, but Edgleen isn't small. And some of Perez's underlying data is incredible. He chased just 8% of the time and 13% of the time with two strikes in 2024. Those rates will definitely increase as he climbs the minors and faces better pitching, but they're elite for his age. Perez also has a rare combination of hard-hit (45%) and contact rates (83%), with the former generated more by consistency and physical maturity than actual high-end power. Still, Perez's combo of contact ability and on-base skill should allow him to get to the power he has, even if that's only average. Whereas it's often fine for big league catchers to have one competent offensive attribute, Perez could have two or three. 
Teenage catchers are notoriously risky, which impacts Perez's grade, and he's a skills-over-projection type of prospect who lacks enormous physical upside. The Yankees have tended to bring their catching prospects along very slowly, with the likes of Agustin Ramirez, Jesus Rodriguez, and others spending multiple years at a low-level affiliate. But Perez they've pushed, and it's plausible that by the middle or end of 2025, he'll have been promoted to High-A and proven that his plate discipline and contact ability can hold up against better arms. If that's the case, then he's a pretty good bet to be on next offseason's Top 100 list."
Nacho Alvarez Jr.,3B,ATL,2025,,45,Low,22,60,55,35,30,"Alvarez was a nice junior college draft pick in 2022, who has become a contact-oriented third baseman with below-average bat speed; his projected offensive impact is more in line with a second-division regular at the hot corner. Nacho was playing shortstop in the lower minors, and for a while his plate discipline looked as though it might be elite. Since he started facing upper-level arms, though, his on-base skills have played more like a plus attribute, and he has largely shifted to third base due to his lack of range. His foot speed is still a bit of an issue over at third, especially when Alvarez needs to charge slow rollers in front of him, but he is otherwise a smooth and graceful defender. On offense, Alvarez's game is about all-fields doubles contact. His bat speed and power are both below average. He hit .284/.391/.401 combined between Double- and Triple-A in 2024, got an eight-game cup of coffee in July, and will enter 2025 as a depth option. He might be attractive in trade talks to a team that values his contact and zone control."
Gabriel Hughes,SP,COL,2026,,45,Med,23.6,,,,,"Hughes looked incredible out of the gate in 2023 and even dominated the Dodgers' big league lineup during a spring training game, but by July he was running an ERA well over 6.00, sitting 91-92 mph, and needed Tommy John. Hughes returned during the fall of 2024 and pitched during instructs and in the Arizona Fall League and looked fine. 
Hughes attacks with a 93-94 mph fastball that often has a little bit of natural cut. His breaking stuff has plateaued; his 85-88 mph slider/cutter is average and lives off of his command, while his 79-82 mph curveball is well below average. Toss out Hughes' surface-level AFL stats because he was clearly working on this curveball a ton during that stretch. His changeup, a tailing upper-80s offering, is getting better and might be his best pitch at peak. It often has enough tail to run off the front hip of lefty batters and back into the zone. Hughes' prototypical size, athleticism, and arm action augur more changeup growth, as well as strikes and efficient innings. Hughes won't be dominant, and I'm perhaps not appreciating how homer prone he'll be sitting 93 in Colorado, but he should work efficiently and eat innings enough to be a team's no. 4/5 starter during the regular season."
Emiliano Teodo,SIRP,TEX,2025,,45,High,24.1,,,,,"Teodo signed just before the 2020 season that never happened and only popped onto the radar in 2021 when we had consistent minor league activity on the backfields again. He spent 2021 on the complex in Arizona, then toured several universities in Texas with the Rangers' Instructional League squad that was facing college teams in fall scrimmages. Those scrimmages were mostly scouted by folks in amateur departments who were there to evaluate Baylor and Texas Tech more than they were Rangers prospects. Teodo came out sitting 98-101 mph, blowing the minds of scouts sifting through an ocean of college guys sitting 92. 
Since then, Teodo has pitched admirably as a starter all the way to Double-A Frisco. He has consistently posted the same strikeout (31-33%) and walk rates (12%) at every level. Because of his size and below-average control, it's very likely that Teodo will end up pitching in relief, but his stuff is so good that he might be a closer. He's sitting 97-99 and has touched 102 as a starter while working as many as 86 innings in a single season. If there's a reason to be more optimistic about Teodo starting, it's that his delivery doesn't have the effort and violence that is typically required for someone his size to throw this hard. But what seals the relief projection here is Teodo's fastball shape, which is more tail-oriented and is yielding contact rates that are much higher than is typical against a fastball this hard. We buy he's a starter-quality athlete, but he's still going to be a rather inefficient operator. 
Teodo's best sliders are better than his best fastballs. They average 88 mph and spin at roughly 2,800 rpm. His ability to land the pitch for a strike is superior to that of his fastball by a pretty wide margin, and Teodo might even take a slider-first approach if he's put in the bullpen. We had Teodo throwing changeups 6% of the time as of list publication in July. It's not a terrible offering because hitters are so geared up his fastball, and we'd like to see him use it more to really give it a shot at developing. It'd be nice to have even if he shifts to relief."
Joe Whitman,SP,SFG,2027,,40+,Med,23.5,,,,,"Whitman is a super smooth 6-foot-5 lefty with a beautiful arm action and delivery. After two years with just 5.2 total innings pitched at Purdue, Whitman transferred to Kent State for his junior year and had a breakout season. Given the arc of his college career, it seemed feasible that Whitman had both skill and physical development remaining, with a chance to blow up on a pro strength and conditioning program. 
Early on in 2024, it appeared that was happening, as he was touching 96, though Whitman's fastball ended up averaging 92-94 across all of last season. Whitman's size and the pacing of his delivery causes his heater to jump on hitters, and he utilized a fastball-heavy attack in 2024. His slider has mostly lateral action and average length, while his changeup is well below average. The looseness of Whitman's arm action suggests some amount of changeup growth, but his feel for locating it is way behind what's typical for a 23-year-old; too many are errant and obviously in the dirt. How long do you want to hang your hat on Whitman's late-bloomer traits? His size, limited college innings, and small school background are indicators that velo and pitch progression will occur, but right now, he looks like a no.  5 starter. This grade acknowledges that reality while also providing some room for helium around the changeup."
Barrett Kent,SP,LAA,2028,,40+,Med,20.5,,,,,"Kent was the Angels' 2023 eighth round pick out of Pottsboro, TX, and they gave him nearly $1 million to forgo his Arkansas commitment. His carrying attribute was (and remains) his 83-86 mph slider, while lackluster command and the sinking shape of his fastball are barriers between his current abilities and a fit in a big league rotation. 
Kent stands in at a strapping at 6-foot-4 and has pretty clearly been in the weight room since he signed. He doesn't have an uber-projectable frame, but he has already gotten stronger and put himself in better physical position to develop starter-quality control. Kent's lack of fastball movement means that he needs to improve his command in order for it to play. If there's a silver lining to Kent's sinker, it's that its movement should be useful in aiding the development of his changeup, which takes a similar line to the plate at 81-85 mph. Kent's changeup flashed bat-missing tail at the end of 2024, and when he actually deploys it (his usage ranges between 5-8% depending on the start), he does a good job maintaining his heater's arm speed. His slider is easily his best pitch and a future plus offering, with power depth and finish. He's built like a durable innings-eater, he held his high school velocity across 113 innings in 2024, and he has the makings of a viable third pitch. Kent's realistic ceiling (via a leap in changeup quality and command) is that of a no. 4/5 starter."
Michael Mercado,MIRP,PHI,2025,,40+,Med,26,,,,,"Mercado entered pro ball as a high-profile high schooler with a good curveball, coaxed away from Stanford with a $2 million bonus. He developed a meaningfully good cutter in 2022 and was largely deployed as a starter until 2023, when the Rays tried him in the bullpen and Mercado's bat-missing ability took off. Crowded out by Tampa's depth, Mercado was then traded to the Phillies ahead of the 2023 roster deadline and was added to their 40-man. 
Philly used Mercado as a swingman last year. He was in and out of the Iron Pigs rotation early, made a couple big league spot starts, and then was deployed in short relief at the very end of the year. Late in the season, Mercado's seldom-used changeup took an enormous step forward. Once the calendar turned to August, it quickly became Mercado's most-used secondary pitch, and it performed like a plus-plus offering during the last month of play. One in every three or four of Mercado's changeups is really nasty, while the others aren't in enticing locations. But he's barely used it, so his command of it should improve, and I think it'll be a consistently plus pitch soon. Given that his cutter and curveball are also pretty good, it's plausible Mercado could revisit a starter role in the future now that he more clearly has the repertoire depth. But he was also routinely reaching back for 97 at the end of the year in single-inning bursts, has the tools to deal with hitters of either handedness, and seems likely to be a very successful reliever from the jump. There's more upside here than that of just a generic middle reliever, be it via Mercado working four or more outs at a time or eventually stretching out as a starter again. He's a sneaky candidate to be the Phils' third or fourth best reliever this year."
Gary Gill Hill,SP,TBR,2027,,45+,High,20.5,,,,,"Wiry and athletic with especially precocious command given his cold weather, upstate New York origins, Gill Hill compiled a sublime opening four months of his first full professional season (108.2 innings all spent at Low-A Charleston) before slowing down the stretch. Fluid enough to make his crossfire motion look smooth, GGH walked just over 6% of Carolina League hitters in 2024 and was running a 2.40 ERA at the 90-inning mark until he ran out of gas in his final five outings. The 20-year-old right-hander owns the inside half of the plate against righties by pairing a tailing sinker with a two-plane slider out of a low three-quarters slot, and he sells his changeup well enough to dream on it as a tool for suppressing the power lefty hitters started to exhibit against him last year, provided his command of it matures. Already sitting 92-95 mph with substantial projection left, GGH is a mid-rotation prospect whose arrow is pointing up."
Brandon Birdsell,SP,CHC,2025,,45,Med,25,,,,,"Birdsell had Tommy John surgery in high school, spent his freshman year at Texas A&M, his sophomore year at San Jacinto, and then finally ended up at Texas Tech for his junior and senior seasons. He was selected by the Twins in the 11th round of the 2021 draft, but an ill-timed shoulder injury resulted in him returning for his senior season, and a year later he was a fifth round selection by the Cubs. 
Birdsell has been durable and consistent in pro ball, and reached Triple-A with little resistance. In 2024, he worked 135.2 innings and walked just 31 batters. He has an ultra-short arm action, and the simplicity of his entire operation helps him stay consistent. Birdsell attacks with a ton of downhill mid-90s fastballs and a curt, 88-90 mph two-plane slider that he almost always puts right on the corner of the plate. Birdsell doesn't really have a weapon to deal with lefties. He has a low-80s curveball, but it doesn't have the huge depth or arm-side tilt of a platoon-neutral curve. Vulnerability to lefties will prevent Birdsell from being an impact mid-rotation type, but he's almost certainly going to be an innings-eating no. 4/5 starter."
Ryan Sloan,SP,SEA,2029,,45,Med,19.2,,,,,"Sloan was one of the more exciting high school pitching prospects in the 2024 draft, ranking 28th in the class on draft day. He is a powerful righty, albeit a more physically mature one, with a gorgeous and strong delivery and a great breaking ball. He was up to 98 during his senior spring after sitting 91-93 the summer before, and he was also throwing a harder breaking ball. Sloan's longer arm swing might make changeup development challenging, and he was definitely more ""in-zone bully"" than ""corner-painting prodigy"" in high school, but a plus fastball/slider combo and impressively athletic delivery are great ingredients for Sloan and the Mariners dev group to work with. He has mid-rotation upside."
Cristian Mena,SP,ARI,2025,,45,Low,22.3,,,,,"Mena is a precocious and athletic 21-year-old righty who made his big league debut in 2024 and then was shut down for the rest of the season a few weeks later with a forearm strain. The White Sox signed Mena in 2019 and the start of his career was delayed due to the pandemic, yet he was still just 18 years old when he first took a pro mound in 2021. In 2023, at age 20, he was the youngest pitcher in baseball to reach Triple-A. Stocked with tweener outfielders, the Diamondbacks acquired Mena from Chicago in exchange for Dominic Fletcher just before the 2024 season. 
Since arriving in Arizona, Mena has trimmed his physique, changed his delivery (it's more cross-bodied now), and is throwing his breaking balls much harder; they now bend in around 84-87 mph rather than the 82-84 mph range they did while Mena was with Chicago. But the issues that have otherwise plagued Mena during his prospectdom largely remain. His fastball lacks effective movement and he was once again homer-prone in 2024. Some of his 21.1% HR/FB rate in 2024 has to do with the PCL hitting environment, but Mena has had a HR/FB rate of 15% or more in three of his four pro seasons and has allowed an OPS over 1.000 against his heater each of the last two years. The two-seamer and Mena's changeup, a glorified sinker in the 88-91 mph range, should give him a way to stay off barrels, and his delivery and arm action are so athletic and lovely that you can project heavily on the changeup. Two good breaking balls — a slider and a curve with velocities that have tended to blend — have long been the staple of Mena's profile and remain so. Both are tough to pick up out of Mena's hand, and he tends to locate them when he isn't overthrowing. 
Mena's season-ending forearm injury clouds his immediate future a little bit, and his fastball's vulnerability caps his ceiling, but he has plus breaking stuff and a delivery/athleticism combo that indicates he might develop a plus changeup and plus command. Mena is likely to be a steady, strike-throwing no. 4/5 type of starter."
Chase Hampton,SP,NYY,2025,,45,Med,23.6,,,,,"Hampton was shut down after the 2022 draft and debuted during 2023 big league spring training with more velocity than he had in college, which he proceeded to maintain across 106.2 innings. He blew away Sally League hitters (40.5% K%) in the first half of the year before he seemed to lose his legs a little bit in the second half at Double-A Somerset. His line to the plate became less consistent, the timing of his fairly long arm stroke wavered, and he had some walk-prone starts in the mid-to-late summer. A flexor tendon strain shelved him for the first half of 2024. Hampton returned in July and pitched for a little over a month (never more than 3.2 innings at a time) before he was shut down again, this time with a strained groin. His peak velocity wasn't present during his active window; Hampton's heater averaged 92 and topped out at 94. It has enough riding life to be okay even with below-average velocity, but obviously it would be better if Hampton returns to the 93-96 range (his 2023 peak) in 2025. 
Hampton mixes in a healthy dose of his secondary stuff as he navigates opposing lineups. He bends in a 12-to-6 curveball in the 75-79 mph range, a two-plane low-80s slider, and an upper-80s cutter. The curveball can sometimes have enough bend back toward his arm side to act as a defacto changeup versus lefties, and Hampton can get ahead of hitters with his secondary stuff and then get them to chase his fastball above the zone. His breaking balls all have distinct shapes and velocities, giving him enough of a mix to consider him a starter even though he doesn't have a changeup or a split. There's a version of Hampton that returns with the velocity he's had for most of his career — a fastball in the low 90s — and projects as a no. 4/5 starter, and then there's the apex version we saw for a few months in 2023 who would more cleanly fit in the middle of a rotation. Because of what Hampton has tended to be throughout his career, here he's projected as the former."
Drue Hackenberg,SP,ATL,2026,,45,Med,23,,,,,"From the many athletic Hackenbergs (his brother was once the Jets' woebegone quarterback), Drue was a 2023 draft-eligible sophomore at Virginia Tech whose spring ERA approached 6.00. Unranked and evaluated as a 40-FV reliever at the time of the draft, Hackenberg got a hefty bonus right around $2 million as Atlanta's second round pick. In his first full pro season, he worked 129 innings, had a 3.07 ERA, 26.3% K% and 11.3% BB%, and reached Triple-A for his final four starts of the season. 
Hack and the Braves have altered his fastball usage, mixing a four-seamer in with his college sinker; the two pitches have radically different shapes. His fastball's velocity climbed a little bit in the middle of 2024, and he was sitting 92-95 by the time he got to Gwinnett. A lack of fastball effectiveness was part of why Hackenberg surrendered 113 hits in 85.1 innings as a sophomore at Tech, and development in this area is the chief reason why his FV grade has been elevated since he signed. Hackenberg's slurve was always excellent and continues to be. It sits in the 81-85 mph range and has power, two-plane action. He also has a flat, terse cutter in the 86-89 mph range and an upper-80s changeup in the nascent stages of development. His command isn't yet good enough for him to be a Top 100 prospect. Hackenberg's ability to generate groundballs will bail him out of self-imposed traffic at times, but he looks more like a no. 4/5 type than a mid-rotation stalwart at this time."
Jordy Vargas,SP,COL,2027,,45,High,21.4,,,,,"Vargas is a loose, ultra-projectable, strike-throwing starter prospect with a curvaceous breaking ball who missed 2024 recovering from Tommy John surgery. He checks every scouting box one could hope that a young pitching prospect would check, aside from maybe his fastball shape. From ages 18 to 20, Vargas' fastball would sit 93-95 early in outings, and he's built and moves in such a way that he might end up throwing considerably harder as his body fills out. He's super loose, balanced, and mechanically consistent for a pitcher his age, in the Cristopher Sánchez or Brady Singer mold in terms of build and delivery.  
Vargas' curveball is a knee-buckling parabola of death, he's adept at creating tail on his changeup, and his general athleticism and the looseness of his arm action portend continued growth in this area. His fastball's shape doesn't really complement his curveball right now, and similar to Singer, it might be tough for Vargas to miss bats with his heater unless he ends up throwing really hard (he was 92-94 during instructs in the fall of 2024) or makes a change to the pitch's shape. 
Vargas is also a good bit behind the developmental curve due to the unfortunate timing of his late-2023 Tommy John, which cost him all but a handful of developmental innings during instructs. The 2025 season is technically Vargas' 40-man platform year, but the 64 Low-A innings he pitched before he blew out in 2023 were a career high. How the Rockies handle his innings load and promotion pace in 2025 will be interesting. They've experienced the drawbacks of adding very young pitching to their 40-man roster too soon (Helcris Olivarez), but Vargas is very talented and fairly polished for his age, so it's plausible he could be sniped in the Rule 5 Draft if left unprotected. He's among the most exciting pitching prospects in Colorado's system and has the look of a college pitcher who gets drafted in the middle of the first round."
Dax Fulton,SP,MIA,2025,,45,Low,23.5,,,,,"Fulton was actually throwing a little bit harder in the early part of 2023 (averaging 93.5 mph per Synergy, a tick and a half more than 2022) before he blew out and had a mid-June Tommy John, a little less than five years after his first one; he spent the 2024 season on the 60-day IL. As is customary, Fulton's FV grade hasn't changed as a result of his TJ, but I've slid him to the back of his tier until he shows he's healthy again. 
Fulton's arm stroke is super short for such a tall pitcher, and this mechanical funk and the extreme downhill angle of his fastball combine to make him an uncomfortable at-bat. He commands two solid secondary pitches, the best of which is a breaking ball in the 78-84 mph range. His height and vertical arm slot give his fastball steep angle that runs counter to the flat-angled, bat-missing modern heater, but it takes hitters a few tries to get comfortable with it because of the unique look Fulton presents. His curveball also doesn't pop out of his hand — because he's so freaking big, it's always descending after it leaves the southpaw's fingertips — and it looks much more like his fastball out of the hand than is typical of pitchers with slower (by today's standards) breaking balls. This pitch can either miss a bat (it plays as a backfoot offering to righties), get a groundball (which Fulton does a lot of), or land in the zone for a strike. He can turn over the occasional average changeup and at least locate his change consistently.
Fulton is a relatively stiff athlete without the mechanical grace and ease that would typically lead one to project on the velocity, but even if this is all there ever is, Fulton is still a no. 4/5 starter type, the sort on the fringe of making a contender's playoff rotation. He throws a starter's rate of strikes, his fastball has some non-traditional ""round up"" traits, he can bend in a nasty hook, and he'll hopefully get over this most recent injury and eat a ton of innings."
Trey Sweeney,SS,DET,2025,,45,Low,24.9,40,40,45,40,"The 20th overall pick in 2021, Sweeney adjusted to pro ball pretty quickly despite his small school pedigree. He reached Double-A during his first full season, and was sent to the Dodgers for Victor González and Jorbit Vivas the following year. Then in 2024, he was traded to Detroit as part of the Jack Flaherty deal and made his debut in mid-August. He's a career .254/.356/.435 hitter in the minors. Sweeney's carrying tools are his rare raw power and bat speed for a lefty-hitting shortstop. He posted a 46% hard-hit rate and a 105.4 mph EV90 in 2024, both comfortably above the average of a big league shortstop. But Sweeney has never quite been able to access all of his power in games because of the downhill nature of his swing, which also causes him to swing over top of a lot of breaking balls, and because he lacks great feel for flush contact. His chase rate also really popped during his 36-game big league sample at the end of 2024, though that has not tended to be an issue for him historically. 
On defense, Sweeney is a bit slower and heavier-footed than the typical big league shortstop. He does enough to be playable there, but he's definitely below average. Some of the sweet looking plays he makes at the very extremes of his range an average big league shortstop would make look more routine. Sweeney is built like Josh Jung, and it's rare for an athlete that size to be an impact shortstop glove. He's got a second-division regular's look."
Jhonny Level,2B,SFG,2030,,40+,Med,18,50,50,50,50,"Level signed for just shy of $1 million in 2024 and hit a robust .275/.393/.517 with 10 homers in 48 games. He's built like Jasson Domínguez, with huge pythons, pecs, and traps, and Level won't turn 18 until March. A lack of arm strength will likely limit him to second base, putting pressure on his offensive tools to be loud enough for him to be an everyday player. As you can imagine, there's practically no raw power projection here because Level is already so strong and maxed out. The good news is that he's a talented enough hitter to have a puncher's chance to profile as an everyday option. Level is an explosive rotator from both sides of the plate (especially the left side), and he has roughly average bat control, maybe a little better than average as a lefty. Things here are off to an encouraging start. Level should be stateside in 2025 and could finish the season as a teenager in full-season ball. "
Max Muncy,SS,ATH,2025,,40+,High,22.6,40,40,45,50,"Muncy was limited to 233 plate appearances in 2024 due to a back injury, and he finished with a 24.6% strikeout rate at Triple-A Las Vegas while posting a .866 OPS. Below-average rates of contact will probably always be part of his game, and ultimately will be what funnels Muncy into a utility infield role. Breaking ball chase is the main culprit here, though importantly, Muncy has enough power to keep his overall offense afloat. An important 2024 development: Muncy finally got experience at the second base. He appears more comfortable and well-suited for the keystone than third base. He turns the double play well on both ends, and projects to be an average defender at shortstop and an above-average defender at second base. Muncy’s ability to be a sound defender up-the-middle is the carrying trait of his profile. His isn't devoid of offensive ability, but it will be important for him to learn to control the zone better over time. Muncy has a good chance to debut toward the end of 2025."
Denzer Guzman,SS,LAA,2026,,40+,Med,21.1,30,30,40,60,"Guzman was the Angels' top 2021 international amateur signee at just shy of $2 million. He has yet to have an impressive statistical full-season performance, with a mid-80s wRC+ at Low- and Double-A each of the last two years. He's another of the Angels' prospects who almost completely skipped over their High-A affiliate in southeast Washington. Guzman is only 20, putting his .206/.297/.304 line at Double-A Rocket City (west of Huntsville, Alabama) in a more forgiving light. To the eye, he still looks like a good defensive shortstop with a shot to develop above-average raw power at peak.
Guzman's tools are like Diet Willy Adames. He has cleaned up some of the odd looking aspects of his defensive actions (which were once strange and stiff when he had to make plays in on the grass), and he's really great at backhanding balls in the hole and making strong throws back across his body. Guzman is also an impressive in-the-box rotator and swings pretty hard for a 20-year-old, but his cut is quite long and grooved. Guzman has had concerningly high strikeout rates in the minors and lacks any kind of barrel feel, and he probably won't get to all his raw power in games because of this. This is the biggest hurdle for Guzman to clear if he's going to develop into an everyday shortstop. He's more likely to be a utility infielder who runs into a dozen annual bombs."
Justin Crawford,CF,PHI,2027,,40+,High,21.2,50,40,30,70,"Crawford has exciting physical ability, he's a great surface-level performer who owns a career .316/.371/.442 line, and he reached and had success at Double-A during the final two months of the 2024 season. His underlying contact and power metrics are also excellent for Crawford's age (a 87% in-zone contact and a 42% hard-hit rate, for instance). Why then is he merely a 40+ FV prospect, essentially the grade of a premium fifth outfielder? I don't trust that Crawford's swing will translate to big league success as it is currently constituted. His lever length, the height and depth where his hands load, and Crawford's bat path all cause him to be late to the contact point an overwhelming majority of the time. He peppers the left field line with low-lying contact and is really only capable of pulling slower breaking balls that finish middle-in. Crawford's groundball rate was 70% in 2023 and 61% in 2024. This century, there are only a handful of players with 900 career PA or more who hit the ball on the ground that often. Several of them were good big leaguers — Marlins great Luis Castillo was the best among them, while guys like Ben Revere and Nori Aoki were solid regulars during their peaks — but each of them was also an elite contact hitter with K rates hovering around 10%, and this is where they differ from Crawford. Not only will Crawford's ability to slug against big league stuff (and defenses) be limited by his swing's tendency to drive the ball into the ground, but he may have serious issues against high fastballs that simply haven't been exposed yet by mid-minors velocity. Crawford also isn't an especially skilled center fielder; his reads and routes aren't great. His speed should allow him to be okay there in time, but it isn't a value-adding aspect of his profile. 
I don't want this blurb to be an onslaught of negativity. Crawford won the Paul Owens Award last year, he has unbelievable lower body athleticism that you can see in his best swings, and his speed is exciting, as is his power, especially given his age and long-term physical projection. I'm just skeptical any of that power will actualize if this is still his swing when the cement dries. I can also see how it might be hard for Crawford and the Phillies to change things proactively when the player has had nothing but success. If additional strength arrives in Crawford's mid-20s, and enables him to shorten up and be on time to pull the baseball more, then Crawford has the underlying strength and bat control combo to immediately break out; that's what the ""+"" in 40+ is there for. Until then, there are things about Crawford's profile that give me pause or feel suspect, both visually and statistically. He reads as the sort of player who has a comfortably sub-.100 ISO even though he hits the ball pretty hard, a speedy nine-hole hitter type without impact defense."
Theo Gillen,CF,TBR,2028,,45+,Med,19.5,60,60,50,55,"When Gillen first burst onto the prospect scene, he was a skinny shortstop with a great looking lefty swing. He dealt with injuries of varying severity throughout high school, the most significant of which required labrum surgery. In addition to their toll on Gillen, the injuries made it difficult to evaluate him, as even when he was healthy, he sometimes looked rusty. Now he's getting stronger, and looks more comfortable in the box the further away he gets from his injuries. He is one of the few players in last year's draft class who could hit, hit for power, and also projects to play an up-the-middle position. 
Gillen has quick and slick hitting hands. His swing looked long during his pre-draft summer, but he's meaningfully stronger now and is getting back to the ball quicker. He rotates hard while keeping his head on the baseball and makes a ton of sweet spot contact. A scout source told Eric they thought Gillen had a chance to be a left-handed Marcus Semien — that's what Gillen's hitting hands are like. It's also the path Gillen's body and defensive fit could follow as he fills out. While Gillen's lateral agility and arm strength probably aren't a fit at shortstop (his high school position), his middle infield experience and speed give him a good shot to play second base or maybe try center field. We think the former is more likely. Especially if he continues to get stronger, his hit/power combo will profile in an everyday capacity at either spot."
Tommy Troy,SS,ARI,2027,,45,Med,23.2,35,30,45,80,"Troy was exposed by pro-quality breaking balls during a rough 2024 at High-A Hillsboro, where he hit .227/.319/.347 and missed time with a hamstring injury. Though Troy posted a stellar Arizona Fall League statline, he still looked allergic to spin there. He now has a utilityman projection here because it looks unlikely that he's going to hit enough to be an everyday player. Troy can really swing hard and rotates with more explosion than is typical for hitters his size. His scissor-kick swing is geared for banging high fastballs to the opposite field gap but, especially against breaking balls, he isn't on plane with the pitch for very long. Per Synergy, Troy missed 47% of the sliders he swung at in 2024 (reminder: this was at High-A), which is a gigantic spike from his 31% rate at Stanford. For context, Mason Miller's slider had a 48% miss rate in 2024. Troy can crush a fastball, but if he is essentially turning opposing sliders into elite pitches, then big league hurlers aren't going to let him see heaters. Troy now has a pretty extreme power-over-hit offensive profile. His speed is going to add a relevant element to what he brings to a lineup, but his issues with breaking balls are going to make him a streaky hitter at the very least, and on the whole probably it probably won't be enough for him to be an everyday player. 
If there's good news here, it's that Troy has been improving at shortstop. Though he played all over the place at Stanford and looked like he had settled in at third base in his draft year, the Diamondbacks have mostly deployed Troy at short. He's very tightly wound, a much more explosive athlete than an elegant and fluid one, and in the past he struggled with some of the tougher, off-platform throws that big league teams expect their shortstops to make, though he has improved in this regard. He began playing more second base in 2024, especially in the AFL, and based on Troy's look at third base in college, it's reasonable to expect he'll also be able to play there. Troy's speed also gives him a shot to play center field if the D-backs want to give that a try; he played some corner outfield in college but never center. Unless Troy's contact ability miraculously improves in 2025, he isn't on the fast track to the big leagues. He and Arizona have all of 2025 and 2026 to flesh out his fits on defense so that he can compete for a superutility role on the big league roster in 2027."
JR Ritchie,SP,ATL,2026,,45,High,21.8,,,,,"A classic high school pitcher draft prospect, Ritchie had a projectable 6-foot-2 frame, a fast, whippy arm action and a snappy, devastating breaking ball as a Pacific Northwest prepster in 2022. His gorgeous arm action portended changeup development, and his feel for spin allowed you to project that Ritchie would develop a second good breaking ball over time. It took $2.4 million to keep him from a commitment to UCLA, and Ritchie sadly blew out after just four 2023 starts. He returned in June 2024 and ended up throwing 49.2 innings across 11 combined starts between his rehab on the complex, age-appropriate Low-A starts, and two High-A outings to cap the year. 
Ritchie didn't come out of his rehab having taken a meaningful physical step; he's still a slender fella who sits 91-93 and requires rather violent, high-effort arm speed to generate it. Ritchie would show you 94-96 in short bursts as an amateur, but he's been more in the low-90s since his senior spring of high school, and now he's approaching age 22. What did take a step forward coming out of his TJ rehab was Ritchie's changeup, which now has a one-seam sinker look out of hand. Even with below-average velocity, there's enough other stuff happening here for Ritchie to continue to project as a starter, though his FV is shaded down a tier from last cycle because he didn't have a velo spike coming out of rehab. That might still happen for him, but as we're sitting here, Ritchie has mostly averaged 92 since the spring of 2022, and I think at this point it's incumbent upon him to actually throw harder rather than wishcasting more velocity for him. He still has the look of a good team's no. 4/5 starter thanks to his quality secondary pitches."
Sterlin Thompson,LF,COL,2026,,45,Low,23.8,50,55,50,40,"Thompson is a left-handed Miguel Vargas of sorts, a bat-only prospect without superlative physicality. Built in the Daniel Murphy and Nolan Schanuel mold, Thompson isn't an especially mobile athlete, and he has trended down the defensive spectrum during the last few years from 2B/3B to 1B/LF, where he isn't particularly sound. Thompson has great hands in the batter's box, his pretty swing generates airborne contact from pole to pole, and he does not miss mistakes. He's going to actualize the power he has, but it will only be fair pop unless something about his physicality changes drastically in his mid-20s. Now a career .270/.345/.430 hitter in the minors, Thompson has a roughly average contact and power combination undercut a bit by a lack of plate discipline. It's enough to consider him a high-probability platoon piece, but not enough to consider him a foundational everyday player at the positions he's capable of playing."
Jace Jung,3B,DET,2025,,45,Med,24.5,40,40,55,30,"Over 30 years after Mickey Tettleton played his last game for the Tigers, they've finally addressed their lack of a power-over-hit type who tilts his barrel toward the backstop and offers above-average left-handed thump. Jung made his major league debut last August, two years after a dominant run at Texas Tech made him a top-15 overall pick – and five years after his older brother Josh did the same. Jung’s big league arrival came in spite of a June wrist injury that eventually required offseason surgery, and while he posted his typical walks-and-pop shaped batting line at Triple-A (.257/.377/.454), he underperformed against same-handed velocity and saw his power production ebb after hitting 28 homers in 2023.
Jung’s unique setup and steeply vertical bat angle betray his choice of launch over contact, and his uppercut whip of a swing reinforces those expectations, producing plus exit velocities and fly ball rates in the 40s throughout his time in the minors. The majority of Jung’s hard contact comes on pitches middle-away, but he can turn-and-burn on inner half heaters regularly enough to remain a threat across the zone. While Jung’s power didn't show up in his first 94 plate appearances in Detroit and he struck out at a 30.9% clip, a peek under the hood reveals that he makes a below-average but not cripplingly low amounts of in-zone contact, and he rarely expands the width of the strike zone while running deep counts.
While Jung doesn't have the height of the prototypical corner masher, he certainly moves like one. A shift to third base last season helped hide his well-below-average foot speed, but he'll make less use of Comerica’s Park ample foul territory than others might. Rather than flash much lateral range, Jung’s best plays see him charging in, as he typically takes several steps toward first to make his below-average arm strength play across the diamond. There’s enough power, patience, and serviceable glovework here for Jung to be the bat-first strong side of a third base platoon right now, but his bid to be an everyday regular might not survive if he slides any further down the defensive spectrum."
Eriandys Ramon,3B,CHC,2027,,40+,High,22.2,50,55,45,40,"Ramon signed in June of 2023, when he was 20 years old, and began 2024 on the complex, where he (and Yahil Melendez) were the tallest, most projectable young hitters on the Sloan Park backfields. Though not especially explosive, Ramon has a terrific skills foundation and a broad-shouldered build that might allow him to add significant strength as he matures. This guys checks an awful lot of boxes we care about. He's a switch-hitter who has demonstrated feel for contact, he has overt physical projection that might lead to more power, and he's a good defensive player. Ramon is a very graceful and athletic shortstop, especially for a 6-foot-3 guy, and if it weren't for his lack of speed, he'd comfortably project to stay there. For now, he's projected as a plus third base defender. 
Ramon's swing is already short to the ball for a young, physically green guy his size. He's on time to pull as both a left- and right-handed hitter, and his lefty swing has natural loft. If Ramon shows up to 2025 camp having gotten meaningfully stronger during the offseason, he could blow up. If there's a volatile aspect of his profile that threatens to undermine his ascent, it's his plate discipline. Though he's behind the developmental curve as he approaches his 22nd birthday, Ramon only has a year-and-a-half of pro ball under his belt, and his frame and (hopefully) his feel for the zone will both improve via strength training and reps. We're excited enough about his feel to hit, defense, and long-term physical projection to put Ramon in this higher-upside FV tier."
Rayner Arias,RF,SFG,2029,,40+,High,18.9,40,30,55,50,"Mere months after signing, Arias looked great during 2023 spring training against pitchers much older and more advanced than him. Then he went back to the D.R. and after a dominant first few weeks in the DSL, he broke his left wrist while diving for a ball in the outfield and his season was over. Arias again looked fantastic during 2024 minor league spring training and during the early portion of extended, but he again dove for a ball in the outfield, got up in pain, and slammed his glove to the turf in frustration. He had injured his wrist again, a sprain this time, and was out until mid-June. Arias played for roughly six weeks before the end of the complex schedule and has only played 41 career regular season games in two pro seasons. His ""healthy"" window in Arizona wasn't great; Arias slashed .250/.371/.364 with a 25.7% strikeout rate at the Giants' windy Papago Park bandbox, running a sub-70% contact rate, and his swing often looked long and grooved. We won't truly know whether these issues were due to the lingering effects of multiple wrist injuries or are a reflection of Arias' actual ability as a hitter until he generates a relevant data sample in 2025. 
I'm comfortable leaning heavily on my priors here, which include very exciting in-person looks and much better measureable contact and power data in 2023, before Arias first got hurt. But again, both the good pre-injury data and bad post-injury sample are too small to really care about. Still, I'm inclined to leave room for a big bounce back in 2025. Arias is still a big-framed outfield prospect with really exciting long-term strength projection. He could have special power at peak and be a Tyler O'Neill type of hitter even if his strikeout issues persist. It's frustrating that Arias' career has yet to truly get off the ground and it will be a problem for his prospect standing if he looks healthy in 2025 but still runs a 68% contact rate, but I still value his upside enough to grade him like a second round high school prospect."
Tommy White,3B,ATH,2026,,40+,Med,22.1,40,50,55,40,"A barrel-chested college baseball cult hero with plus bat speed, White was among the highest-profile transfers of the last few years, heading from NC State to LSU after an incredible freshman season. He slashed .355/.419/.704 throughout his college career with 75 homers in three seasons, and signed for $3 million as the A's second rounder in 2024, getting 25 professional games under his belt after the draft. 
White's calling card is his power. His operation in the batter’s box is very rhythmic and uses a hand hitch trigger and toe tap timing mechanism. His hands aren't exceptionally quick on their own, but White's ability to rotate explosively through his hips, combined with the loft in his bat path, produces above-average power. Chase issues make his overall profile risky. White got better in this regard as a junior (38% chase in 2023, 32% in 2024), but then backpedaled after the draft in a 119-PA pro sample (39%). White’s pitch selection ultimately limits his hit tool's ceiling; he's going to be a low-OBP player, and he'll need to get to his raw power during game action to cover up for this shortcoming. Jake Burger and Maikel Franco are similar players, though White plays better defense than either of those guys.  
A surprisingly mobile, low-to-the-ground defender for his size, White's ability to control his body well on the run puts him in a good fielding position, which allows him to cover up for below-average hands. White will have to stay as lithe and quick as possible, which can be challenging for athletes built like he is, but he has a better shot to stay at the hot corner than you'd guess when he gets off the bus. The warts on White’s offensive profile are real, but he'll bring enough value to the table with his power and ability to stay at third that he likely ends up as a regular on a lesser club, or more of a 1B/3B part-timer for a championship-caliber team."
Joel Hurtado,SIRP,LAA,2026,,40+,Med,24.1,,,,,"Hurtado pitched in a piggyback role in 2023 and then as a starter for all of 2024, when he worked 138.2 innings at High-A Tri-City. He is still very unpolished, both from a strike-throwing standpoint and as far as repertoire depth is concerned. A full 87% of Hurtado's pitches were either fastballs or sliders again in 2024, so unless you count his two different fastballs as independent offerings (they do have well demarcated movement profiles), he's a two-pitch guy with well-below-average control. For this reason, Hurtado is projected as a reliever here at FanGraphs, but don't let that discourage you from being excited about his prospects. Hurtado held mid-90s velocity across a huge innings uptick in 2024, and his slider generated a 44% miss rate, per Synergy. Because he throws so many of them nowhere near the zone, his 84-88 mph gyro slider only plays like a plus pitch when opponents decide to swing at it. He needs to improve his command, but if he does, his slider will be a plus offering, maybe even better than that. 
A move to the bullpen might enable Hurtado to sustain the upper-90s velocity he shows at peak. He looks an awful lot like Cubs reliever Daniel Palencia in terms of his build, arm stroke, arm slot, and maybe even his peak velocity if Hurtado shifts into the bullpen. He's on a December 2025 40-man/Rule 5 Draft timeline, so look for him to maybe shift into relief sometime this coming season so the Angels can see what that looks like and make an informed decision about whether or not to roster him."
Bryce Cunningham,SP,NYY,2027,,40+,High,22.3,,,,,"Cunningham split time between starting and relieving as an underclassman before rooting into Vandy's weekend rotation as a junior. He nearly doubled his career high in innings pitched, but still held 93-95 mph fastball velocity all season. Cunningham's career ERA was a shade under 5.00, but his stuff was good enough for him to rank 47th on my Draft Board. The Yankees popped him in the second round and Cunningham didn't pitch after the draft. 
At a strapping 6-foot-5, Cunningham is an athletic mover who strides somewhat open as he pedals home. He throws from a three-quarters arm slot with a 1:00 fastball spin axis, and he might benefit from supination on release to create more carry on his fastball. A short, blunt, below-average mid-80s slider was his most used secondary in 2024, but a high-spin, mid-80s changeup is Cunningham's best pitch. His strike-throwing was a little less consistent late in the college season, but that was to be expected considering his workload. Cuningham needs breaking ball augmentation, but he has realistic no. 4 starter upside if the Yankees can help with that."
Alex McFarlane,SIRP,PHI,2026,,40+,High,23.8,,,,,"I considered McFarlane to be a pure relief prospect when he was at Miami, but the Phillies decided to try to develop him as a starter, and for the first two months of 2023, it looked as though they really had something. He punched out 50 hitters in his first 37 innings and worked efficiently enough to pitch into the fifth and sixth inning during several starts, a rarity for him at Miami. About halfway through the season however, the Phillies began to drastically limit the length of McFarlane's outings, his stuff waned, and he was ultimately shut down at the end of August 2023. He had Tommy John that September, which put him out for all of 2024.
Healthy 2025 McFarlane could enjoy a Kerkering-like rise through the minors, especially if the Phillies decide to 'pen him. When he was totally healthy early in 2023, McFarlane was sitting 98-100 mph, then backed into the 94-97 range closer to when he was shut down. His monster arm strength helps make up for his fastball's tailing shape, created by his nearly side-arm delivery. His gyro slider induced a plus-plus 21% swinging strike rate against A-ball hitters (an important caveat) in 2023, and McFarlane also has a rare changeup that he threw fewer than 50 times before he was shut down. 
There were good reasons for the Phillies to try to develop McFarlane as a starter. Miami doesn't seem to max out their pitchers on campus, and McFarlane's fastball featured better sink in pro ball. He also has a great pitcher's frame and is a fabulous on-mound athlete. But now that he's about to enter his 40-man evaluation season with so few innings under his belt, it's much more likely McFarlane is moved quickly as a potential late-inning weapon, assuming his stuff comes back after his rehab."
Juan Nunez,SP,SDP,2025,,40+,Med,24.3,,,,,"Nuñez came to the O’s in the 2022 trade that sent Jorge López to Minnesota. He made his full-season debut in 2023, throwing just over 100 innings, and Nuñez was off to a great start in 2024 when he was shut down for the season in May with a shoulder injury. He was sitting 92-95 and touched 97 before he got hurt, and he has rare fastball spin, averaging around 2,500 rpm. Still, it’s an average fastball that played down due to Nuñez’s lack of command. Nuñez’s secondary stuff is awesome. His best sliders have sharp, two-plane shape with late break, and they’re nasty enough to freeze hitters or get them to chase. Because of his fastball’s in-zone vulnerability, Nuñez often uses his breaking ball as a way to get ahead of hitters. His least used pitch is a firm changeup at 85-88 mph that will flash unhittable, late diving action. It’s thrown with the same arm speed and falls off the table when Nuñez releases it right. Too often, he’ll throw changeups that are easily identifiable as balls out of hand. The pitch mix to start is here, and despite being listed at 5-foot-11, Nuñez has a very sturdy, muscular build and a gorgeous arm action that quell one’s concerns about him needing to work in relief due to a lack of size. Nuñez has pitched just 20 games above Low-A and will probably need to work in an inefficient relief role to stick on San Diego’s roster in 2024."
Tyler Callihan,2B,CIN,2025,,35+,Med,24.8,40,40,45,50,"Callihan is a power-hitting 2B/LF who ran a sub-70% contact rate in 2024. He has average power and his swing is geared to get to it in games. It's enough to consider him an above-replacement player, but it's tough to give Callihan an on-roster grade with only one average tool in his kit."
Brailer Guerrero,RF,TBR,2029,,45+,High,18.8,40,45,55,40,"One of the top handful of 2023 international amateur prospects, Guerrero signed for $3.7 million and had his pro debut season cut short by a torn labrum. Promoted to the Florida complex in 2024, he was having a good year despite strikeout rates around 25%, when shoulder issues cropped up again and he was shut down. He has now played just 35 pro games. 
Guerrero has a powerful, picturesque swing that produces all-fields pop. It's a tad long, but Guerrero easily has the strength to hit for power the other way even when he's late into the hitting zone. This is a very physical 18-year-old — if he showed up for your favorite college's spring football scrimmage, he'd be sent to work out with the defensive ends. He's playing center field right now but probably isn't a long-term fit there, as he's running in the 4.3s already and will probably keep filling out as he matures. The early-career strikeout rates and some visual cues from Brailer's swing (its length makes it tough for him to elevate consistently) create enough risk to have slid Guerrero down into the FV tier typically associated with corner platoon bats (he's also playing a fair bit of right field). That feels like the middle of his potential outcomes, a power-over-hit corner profile that plays against righties in a big way. That doesn't mean Guerrero lacks everyday upside — it's plausible last year's missed reps are the root cause of his current strikeout issues and that he'll remedy them with time."
Ryan Waldschmidt,LF,ARI,2027,,45,Med,22.5,40,40,55,60,"Waldschmidt spent his first college season at Charleston Southern playing a mix of third base and outfield, then transferred to Kentucky for his sophomore and junior years and moved full-time to left field, where he remains a speedy work-in-progress. Like a lot of college hitters, he enjoyed a huge uptick in power output in 2024, clubbing 14 homers and doubling his career total in the process. Waldschmidt had an OPS north of 1.000 and performed well in several key statistical categories at Kentucky, including plate discipline, contact, and measurable power. He had one of the more well-rounded statistical cases of any college hitter in the 2024 draft. 
Visual evaluation of Waldschmidt's hit tool comes in south of his data. His swing is hellacious but atypical. He takes a really healthy hack but does so with basically no stride. Waldschmidt's swing is all hands and torso, and requires a ton of effort, so much that his head kicks around and he often loses sight of the baseball as his body ignites. His hardest swings are truly over in the blink of an eye, like a cobra strike — this guy has big time bat speed and power that plays best (by far) against pitches down-and-in. If he can sustain this approach all the way up the minors, we're talking about a LF/DH who's in the lineup every day. The left field-only profile puts Waldschmidt on thin ice if he can't, in which case, we'd be looking at a Clint Frazier type outcome."
Austin Charles,3B,KCR,2028,,45,High,21.4,35,40,55,55,"Charles was the Royals' last pick in 2022 and signed at the 11th hour after visiting the team's facility. He's a physical outlier at a yoked 6-foot-5, and he is an absurdly coordinated defensive player for someone his size. His swing is a little awkward looking, but Charles was still able to post an above-average wRC+ at Low-A in 2024 at age 20. He's so geared to pull that he swings inside a ton of sliders. If he can quell this tendency, he'll click enough to merit upside-driven Top 100 inclusion a year from now."
Lucas Braun,SP,ATL,2027,,45,Low,23.6,,,,,"Braun didn't pitch very much as an underclassman at San Diego, and it took transferring to Northridge for him to find a real role. He signed for just shy of $350,000 as a 2023 sixth rounder, and in 2024, his second season stretched out as a starter, he worked 143.2 innings and spent the second half at Double-A Mississippi. Braun's delivery is like a Dana Carvey impression of Ryan Walker's delivery. He starts on the extreme third base side of the rubber and uses a cross-bodied stride; it isn't identical to Walker's, but it's in the neighborhood. Braun's sweeper is plus and his release point makes it a nightmare for righties to deal with. It also gives the pitch so much space to break horizontally that it plays nicely as a backfoot weapon against lefties. The rest of Braun's repertoire is a little south of average, but he's a good athlete who hasn't been starting for very long, and his changeup should get better as he continues to use it. Braun's ability to locate all of his pitches is remarkable for someone without much starting experience. If his changeup can take a leap, then Braun has a sneaky shot to be on the Top 100 list 12 months from now. For now, he's another surface-scratching pitcher who the Braves have improved enough to forecast as a stable no. 4/5 starter."
Jaden Hamm,SP,DET,2027,,45,Med,22.6,,,,,"Hamm had an incredible first pro season for a small school starter, as he carved up the Midwest League to the tune of a 2.64 ERA. He struck out 122  and posted a 1.05 WHIP in 99 innings, though he tended to work only about four frames per start. It was a gentle increase from the 91.2 innings he threw the season before combined between Middle Tennessee and his post-draft pro spurt. 
Hamm throws strikes with four different pitches but arguably still has some relief risk due to the nature of his delivery, which features a ton of trunk tilt, an atypical look for a workhorse starter. He shares bodily and mechanical characteristics with former Twins prospect, and current Tiger, Jordan Balazovic. The aspect of Hamm's game that stands out immediately is the vertical movement on his fastball. This is a 20-inch induced vertical break guy, though when you adjust for Hamm's release height (higher releases generate more IVB, and Hamm's is six-and-a-half feet) he's not generating elite ride, but he is deceptive and creates really tough angle on this pitch. More impactful is the way Hamm's release allows his curveball to tunnel with his heater. The two are almost indistinguishable from one another on most of their flight paths, before Hamm's low-80s curve suddenly descends into the zone or beneath it. Hamm's curveball generated a 43% miss rate in 2024, one of the better whiff-inducing curveballs in the minors last year. Off of that he'll show you a changeup and a slider/cutter with distinct lateral shape; both of these pitches live in the mid-80s and are about average. 
Though Hamm's stuff probably won't overwhelm big league hitters, he throws strikes, he has a deep repertoire, he's deceptive, and he has now sustained success across about 100 innings for two years in a row. He has more of a multi-inning relief look mechanically, but in all other ways, he's tracking like a stable no. 4/5 starter. "
Jack Neely,SIRP,CHC,2025,,40+,Med,24.8,,,,,"Neely, who came to the Cubs in the Mark Leiter Jr. trade at the 2024 deadline, is a gigantic guy who hopped around to a several schools (Texas, San Jacinto, Iowa Western, Ohio State) before pro ball. He has been developed solely as a reliever and posted double digit strikeouts per 9 IP up the entire minor league ladder, culminating in a 2024 big league debut with the Cubs after the trade. 
Neely is a standard middle relief prospect. He sits 94-98 mph with plus vertical break and nearly perfect backspinning shape even though he releases from more of a three-quarters slot. He also has an 84-88 mph bullet-style slider that generated elite swing-and-miss in the minors last year. If he can ever learn to locate it more consistently, he'll play a higher leverage role."
Reggie Crawford,SIRP,SFG,2027,,40+,Med,24.3,,,,,"A two-way college player, Crawford's draft status peaked during his pre-draft summer, when he was sitting 100 with Team USA and flashing big power on Cape Cod. He got hurt and had Tommy John that fall and missed his entire junior year, but his upside still demanded an early pick and the Giants popped him 30th overall. Crawford was developed as a two-way player through 2023, but he totaled just 19 innings that year and struck out too much for the experiment to continue. In 2024, Crawford was immediately moved into the bullpen, and it felt as though a singular focus on pitching, combined with clearance to air it out, might allow him to reach the bigs fast. For a while, it looked like that was happening. While wild (15.8% BB%), Crawford was overwhelming Double- and Triple-A hitters (38.5% K%) when his velocity suddenly tanked in an outing in early June, and he was shut down. He was sitting 100 on May 26, and 93 on June 5. Crawford had shoulder surgery toward the end of the season, late enough that he'll likely miss most or all of 2025. 
When he's really humming, Crawford looks like a future closer in the José Alvarado mold. He powers sinkers past hitters all over the zone and flashes a ridiculous mid-80s slider. Crawford's delivery is pretty violent, he's a tightly wound, bulky sort of athlete, and he doesn't repeat his release consistently. Even though he has a viable third pitch (his changeup is fine), he was always likely to be a reliever because of these issues. Now he's had two major injuries and surgeries in a span of about two and a half years. It creates volatility and delay that alters the way Crawford is ""valued"" as a prospect even though his <em>evaluation</em> hasn't changed. Hopefully he returns with his pre-injury stuff. If he does, we could see him in San Francisco sometime in 2026."
Kade Morris,MIRP,ATH,2026,,40+,Low,22.8,,,,,"Morris posted a 5.42 ERA in his draft year but was still a shrewd pickup by the Mets because of his relative youth and projectability for a college prospect, as well as his repertoire depth. In 2024, he reached High-A and then was acquired by the A’s in the deadline deal that sent Paul Blackburn to New York. Morris' walk rates to this point feel a bit faulty. He lacks a consistent release point and was walk-prone at Triple-A toward the very end of the season, and this (plus Morris' skinny build) is driving his long relief projection here. But we think Morris will be a premium version of this archetype. He utilizes both a four-seamer and a sinker (his groundball rate spiked after the A's acquired him), with a tendency to throw the four-seamer from a noticeably higher slot than his sinker. Morris' sinker will show above-average movement, his four-seamer has uphill angle that will allow to it play as a finisher if he improves his command of it to the proper location, and his velo was surging at the very end of the year, when he was sitting 94-95 at Las Vegas. His slider is a two-plane breaker, while the curveball is often 20 mph slower than his fastballs and will flash deep 11-to-5 action. He also brings a changeup to the table that sits in 85-88 mph velo range and features both fade and sinking action; it plays especially well off of his sinker. This is a good pitching prospect even if we're not totally convinced Morris is a starter. He's tracking to debut at some point in mid-to-late 2025."
Chris Cortez,SIRP,LAA,2025,,40+,Med,22.5,,,,,"Cortez began 2024 in Texas A&M's rotation, but he quickly shifted into a relief role and thrived. He was incredible during the college postseason and mowed through several SEC lineups in a high-leverage long relief role, likely bolstering his draft stock late in the process. Cortez is a medium-framed guy with below-average athletic projection. He uses a short-striding, cross-bodied delivery with a low three-quarters slot, which causes his fastball to move and play like that of Justin Martinez of the Diamondbacks. Cortez can pump upper-90s gas with heavy sink across multiple innings. His upper-80s slider has curveball shape when he lands it in the zone, and more sweeper-style movement when it's on the glove-side part of the plate. He threw a handful of changeups in 2024, but he's mostly just a two-pitch guy — perhaps like Martinez, he is a candidate to add a splitter in pro ball. Cortez projects as a quick-moving, impact reliever who'd be the third-best bullpen arm on a good team."
Ben Hess,SP,NYY,2027,,40+,Med,22.6,,,,,"Hess was a three-year starter at 'Bama but was limited to just 30 career starts due to injuries, and he posted a 5.80 ERA as a junior largely because of elevated walk rates. He kept his walks under control as a sophomore, but not in his other two seasons, and his pre-draft grade was heavily influenced by this issue. Hess is a softer-bodied guy, but he's fairly athletic, especially for his size. One could argue he has ""reverse projection,"" meaning that if he and the Yankees can improve his conditioning, it's plausible Hess' stuff and/or command will improve even though on the surface he looks like a maxed-out older guy. 
Hess' fastball topped out at 98 mph in 2024 and averaged 94 mph across the entire season, though it yo-yo'd toward the end. He was up for his SEC tournament game versus LSU (94-96 mph), and then down for his final two starts (92-94 mph). Hess' size helps him create plus extension, and his fastball has rise/run shape. His monster mid-70s curveball, which generated a miss rate north of 50% in 2024, is Hess' nastiest pitch right now. He also has a distinct mid-80s slider, but he lacks feel for breaking ball release and scatters the location of both, especially as far as the slider is concerned. Hess is definitely more of a dev project than most big program starters, but one could argue there's meat on the bone here because he has missed so much time with injury. That said, one could also argue that those injuries make it tough to buy that Hess will sit 94 when he's healthy enough to throw 120 innings. Hess performed like a guy with a ton of relief risk prior to the draft, but the Yankees' ability to develop pitching gives him more ceiling than that."
Robert Calaz,RF,COL,2029,,40+,Med,19.4,30,40,55,40,"Calaz had among the best present raw power in the 2023 international signing class and he has reinforced that assessment so far in pro ball, as he has 19 homers in 105 career games and has posted peak exit velocities (113 mph max, 109 EV90) that would be plus on the big league scale, let alone for a teenage hitter. He clubbed his way off the complex in 2024, spending the final three weeks of the season at Low-A Fresno, and is now a career .336/.436/.603 hitter with 54 extra-base hits in 105 mostly rookie-level games. 
The power aspect of Calaz's profile is for real. Perhaps what is most absurd is how much thump he can generate without a leg kick — he starts with a very wide stance and uses just a little toe tap to get going. A very loose athlete, Calaz rotates with verve and ferocity, but in order to do so, his hips often clear very early, leaving him vulnerable to sliders away from him. This is a pretty serious issue already. Calaz ran a paltry 66% contact rate in 2024, worse than all but one qualified big leaguer (Zack Gelof). There are a handful of very toolsy whiff-prone power hitters in that contact rate area, including Christopher Morel and Logan O'Hoppe, both of whom are sound build/frame comps for Calaz. And Calaz projects to have raw power similar to other players in that group, like Brent Rooker and Adolis García. There's 35-homer ceiling here, but there's also a lot of bust risk because of how many rookie-level strikeouts we're talking about."
PJ Morlando,LF,MIA,2029,,40+,High,19.9,50,50,70,45,"Morlando had the best present power among the high schoolers in the 2024 draft. It's titanic left-handed pop, absurd BP power for a hitter his age; he has made big league parks look small with a wood bat. A strapping, big-framed lefty power bat, he's capable of crushing belt-high fastballs at high school velocities. His long, bottom-hand dominant swing could be vulnerable to Ks against pro velo, but Morlando's 79% contact rate on the showcase circuit was rather encouraging. He doesn't utilize a stride in the box in an attempt to stay compact, but it robs him of athleticism and rhythm, and he might be really late on pro fastballs if it stays this way. The power potential here is massive — Morlando has 30-homer raw in there — it's just not totally clear yet how much of it he'll get to in games because his hit tool is more volatile than his high school showcase contact performance indicates."
Griffin Burkholder,CF,PHI,2029,,40,High,19.6,40,45,50,70,"Burkholder, who ranked 70th on the 2024 Draft Board, was signed away from a West Virginia commitment for $2.5 million in the second round. He's a long-levered speedster whose swing has tended to be on time to pull the baseball even though Burkholder is a lankier guy. Per Synergy Sports, he ran a roughly 73% contact rate on the showcase circuit, which is just south of the big league average. Burkholder's hitting hands fire a little late, but they work well; they're snappy through contact and give him surprising pop for someone his age who is as sinewy as he is. Right now, that manifests as gap-doubles power, and there might be more thump on the way via added strength and perhaps even a tweak to his mechanics. There is currently very little happening with Burkholder's lower body during his swing, and he could stand to have a more athletic cut and see what kind of power arrives. 
Burkholder easily has the speed to play center field, but his balls skills are middling. The likelihood that Burkholder and Dante Nori, who is more obviously a center field fit, traverse the minors together will probably mean they split reps out there, with Nori taking the bigger piece of chicken. Burkholder has the foundation of a part-time outfield prospect, with more offensive upside than that if his frame and swing develop in a meaningful way."
Joe Rock,SP,TBR,2025,,45,Low,24.7,,,,,"Rock is a very deceptive lefty with roughly average stuff and plus control. Though his pitches don't look like they move a ton, Rock still generates average or better chase across his entire repertoire, which consists of a sinker, changeup, slider, and elevated four-seamer. Rock has a small forward's build at a lanky 6-foot-6, and his delivery has an enormous glove raise, during which his shoulder blades nearly touch as Rock's arm action swoops behind him. He looks like a prehistoric bird at the moment he's most splayed out. As elaborate as this looks, Rock is still able to throw a ton of strikes.  He throws both a two- and four-seam fastball; he utilizes the former down in the zone with its tailing action, while he’ll sneak the latter up above hitters' barrels with the aid of the unique angle his release point creates. He sits 91-94 mph with both heaters and, with his frame as thin and long as it is, could easily add a tick more velocity as his body adds strength. The slider is a three-quarters breaking ball in the 83-86 mph range that has late tilt to it, but varying degrees of depth. His 85-87 mph changeup is in the same velo neighborhood as his slider and has fade and sinking action at its best. Rock consistently sells it with fastball arm speed. Rock has shown improvement in his overall strike-throwing ability, but his precision projects to be a tick below average. His arsenal is sufficient to carry a back-of-the-rotation role in the near future, and he has better long-term projection than most 23-year-olds because of his frame. He worked 140 innings in 2024 and is primed to compete for a spot at the back of the Rays rotation in 2025."
Owen Hall,SP,DET,2029,,45,High,19.4,,,,,"A prototypical high school pitching prospect, Hall ranked 32nd on the 2024 Draft Board due largely to his projectable build and breaking ball quality. It only took a modest $1.75 million to sign him away from a Vanderbilt commitment. 
Hall is a skinny 6-foot-3 righty with a condor's wingspan whose fastball velocity was pretty variable during pre-draft looks; he was up to 97 the summer before his draft year but sat 92-94 at times. He works with a high-three-quarters arm slot, but a more vertical hand position on release creates playable riding action on his heater despite its downhill plane. Hall also hides the ball well; his arm action is efficient and should become more consistent as he matures and improves his release consistency. Though Hall often struggles to finish his breaking balls below the zone, both pitches — an upper-70s curve and a low-80s slider — have aesthetically pleasing shape and depth and could be plus if they're thrown harder as Hall's frame fills out. We also have optimism surrounding Hall's changeup projection because of his arm speed and action. Hall is a high-variance project with mid-rotation ceiling. His FV is a shade higher than most prep pitchers who get shy of $2 million."
Jaxon Wiggins,SIRP,CHC,2026,,40+,High,23.5,,,,,"Wiggins was a lights out reliever as a freshman at Arkansas and looked like a potential future top 15 pick, but he struggled as a sophomore when he was moved into the rotation. Then Wiggins' elbow barked and he had Tommy John not long before the start of the 2023 season, his draft year. He already had significant relief risk prior to the injury and this pushed things a little further in that direction. The Cubs took him in the second round and gave him $1.4 million, and Wiggins rehabbed until May of 2024, when he finally got into actual games again. The Cubs quickly shuttled him to High-A and he was dominant at the very end of the season, striking out 17 and allowing just four hits in his final 10 innings. 
Wiggins' rangy 6-foot-6 frame offers substantial projectability and creates a downhill angle on his 96-98 mph fastball. He lacks refined command, but his fastball really holds its plane through the zone and it doesn’t require pinpoint precision in order to be effective. His slider is a mid-80s two-plane breaker with significant depth, but Wiggins is very reliant on chase and only threw it in the zone 31% of the time last season; seasoned hitters might not be as apt to fish for it as A-ballers. His mid-80s changeup took a step forward in 2024 and generated a 42% in-zone whiff rate due to its late vertical depth and Wiggins' ability to mirror his fastball arm speed. There's enough here to justify a stater development track, though we still think the most likely outcome for Wiggins will be a late-inning relief role."
Yordin Chalas,SIRP,ARI,2027,,40+,High,21.2,,,,,"Chalas is a projectable relief prospect who quickly moved from the DSL to the Arizona complex in 2023, and then was pushed pretty aggressively again from Low-A Visalia to High-A Hillsboro in 2024. He is forecast here as a late-inning weapon. 
Chalas is already reaching back for upper-90s heat at 20 years old, he's lanky and projectable, and he's a visually explosive athlete with very powerful and exciting mechanics. He takes a huge stride directly at the plate, he generates big hip and shoulder separation, his arm action looks fluid and natural even though it's relatively curt, and he's balanced over his landing leg throughout his delivery. Though its shape limits its bat-missing utility to the high-and-arm-side quadrant, Chalas has pretty good feel for living in that area; he's going to have a monster fastball at maturity, maybe even an elite one. As soon as Chalas' slider feel clicks, he's going to race to the big leagues. Right now, he struggles to get depth on the pitch (82-86 mph, up to 88 — again, a pitch that we anticipate will have plus velocity at peak), which is common for young pitchers with a lower arm slot like Chalas. In 2025, signs that he has either made any kind of progress or has been tinkering in this area are key variables to monitor. 
His slider is far enough behind that it's the main thing keeping Chalas from having a slam dunk setup man grade here. He'll be able to live off his fastball alone in a meaningful relief role, but a high-leverage job is plausible if any kind of secondary pitch emerges for him."
Chen-Wei Lin,SP,STL,2028,,40+,High,23.4,,,,,"Lin was a notable Taiwanese college pitcher who gained stateside exposure via the Northwoods and MLB Draft Leagues before he signed with the Cardinals for $500,000 in 2023. He pitched a little bit on the Jupiter complex and in A-ball that year, and was very walk-prone. Sent back to Low-A Palm Beach in 2024, Lin's stuff overwhelmed hitters, and he had a great season — 116 innings, 9.54 K/9, 2.79 BB/9, 2.79 ERA — despite still being mechanically inconsistent. His fastball touched 100 several times throughout the season and sat 94-97 for most of the year, and though Lin's velocity tapered a little bit late in the season, he was still a healthy 93-96 in August. 
Lin's skyscraping, 6-foot-7 frame is still nowhere near filled out, and he remains projectable even at age 23. Added strength doesn't need to yield any more velocity, but stamina and body control would be nice. Lin's changeup projects to be his best secondary pitch. It tends to live in the upper-80s and Lin's feel for locating it to his arm side is precocious, but his ability to create bat-missing movement on each one is not. His best ones are plus, and the pitch projects to mature there. The direction of Lin's slider also varies, and that pitch has low-end raw spin, regularly registering under 2,000 rpm. Yes, Lin is 23 and has only pitched at Low-A, but he's now proven he can hold above-average velocity across a lot of innings, and he performed despite being fairly raw. He still has two full seasons left before the Cardinals have to put him on the 40-man, which is plenty of time for him to stretch out to 150 innings or so, and climb a level per year so that he's comfortably in position for an add after 2026. This is a high-ceiling pitching prospect who exceeded expectations in his first pro season and has a shot to be a mid-rotation starter down the line."
Grant Holman,SIRP,ATH,2025,,40+,Med,24.8,,,,,"A two-way player as an underclassman at Cal, Holman transitioned to pitching (as a starter) full-time during his junior year. He enjoyed a velo spike as he was moved to the bullpen in pro ball. Holman is a three-pitch reliever. In 2024, he accumulated 15.2 innings of work at the big league level, where he struck out 16 and walked nine largely working in bursts of one inning or less. He sits 93-95 and hurls his gigantic frame directly at the plate, enabling him to bully the zone with average velocity but plus extension. Both of his secondary pitches are capable of missing bats, and at times, his slider has very impressive two-plane movement for a pitch that bends in around 87 mph. Still, Holman's changeup is his most consistent and dangerous offering, and he racked up a 39.6% swing-and-miss rate on the nearly 100 of them he threw to major league hitters last season. The pitch has bat-missing sink, and Holman tends to command it to enticing locations. His ability to attack hitters of either handedness separates Holman from the generic middle relief group in the 40 FV tier. He has a shot to be a more important bullpen cog behind Mason Miller, perhaps even the Athletics' setup man."
Ryan Johnson,MIRP,LAA,2025,,40+,Med,22.7,,,,,"Perhaps the weirdest of all 2024 draft prospects, Johnson had six double-digit strikeout starts in 2024, amassing 151 total strikeouts and just 14 walks in 106 IP. Johnson set the Dallas Baptist record for strikeouts in a season, became the school's all-time strikeout leader, and finished the year ranked in the top 10 nationally in strikeouts (fourth), BB/9 IP (fourth), ERA (sixth), and WHIP (10th). Why so weird? Johnson has a funky low-slot delivery that features big effort and a huge head whack. He doesn't look like a typical big league starter, but he certainly performed like a starting pitching prospect in college. 
Johnson uses an east/west attack and throws a ton of low-80s sliders. His fastball sits 92-94 with tailing action, and the horizontal divergence between Johnson's fastball and slider was too much for college hitters to deal with. Johnson often changes the pace of his delivery to home, with frequent quick-pitches catching hitters off guard. At first glance, he looks like a deceptive long reliever, but let's be mindful that guys like Tanner Houck have paved the way for pitchers with funkadelic low-slot deliveries like Johnson to develop and thrive as starters. Ideally, Johnson will develop a splitter or something else to fill out his mix and make him better able to tussle with lefties. His grade here leaves room for starter outcomes even though I think it's unlikely."
Henry Lalane,SP,NYY,2027,,40+,High,20.9,,,,,"Lalane was born in the Bronx and is a dual citizen of the United States and the Dominican Republic. His father played basketball at St. Francis College, and Lalane accrued experience at PG tournaments in the US when he was a child. He didn't commit to pitching until he was 14 years old. In 2023, Lalane broke out on the complex and accumulated 34 strikeouts and four walks across a meager 21.1 innings. In 2024, he threw just 12.1 innings sandwiched between IL stints for shoulder inflammation. Lalane's fastball ranged between 93-97 mph in the Yankees' spring breakout game, and then was 89-93 during his brief ""healthy"" window of regular season activity. 
Healthy Lalane routinely locates his fastball and his precocious changeup, which projects to plus at peak. At this size — body-wise, there are a lot of young A.J. Puk and Dax Fulton similarities here — it's plausible Lalane could continue to throw harder as he gets stronger. And he's probably going to need to in order to have a bat-missing fastball because, like Fulton, the downhill trajectory of Lalane's heater causes it to play down. His entire skill set is more about feel and command than nasty pure stuff right now. I'm projecting that there will eventually be a finishing breaking ball here because the ball doesn't pop out of hand from Lalane's release point, but for now, he just has a looking-strike curveball. 
Lalane and the Yankees are caught between a rock and a hard place because the left-hander is entering 2025, his 40-man evaluation season, having not come close to proving that he can maintain good stuff across a starter's load of innings. He's a two-year project who is pretty likely to be handled with care in 2025 so that he can be kept healthy, and so that teams won't even think about sniffing him in next year's Rule 5 Draft. In 2026, however, the restrictor plates will hopefully come off."
Didier Fuentes,SP,ATL,2027,,40+,Med,19.8,,,,,"Fuentes is a loose little righty with a softer build who was having a great 2024 season at Low-A until August, when he was shut down with a blister; he made just one start in September. He allowed just 80 baserunners and struck out 98 in 75.2 innings, mostly living off his ability to locate his fastball to the top of the zone. Fuentes' fastball only sits about 93, but it is utterly dominant thanks to its rise/run action, which is aided by his low-three-quarters release. There were times last year when Fuentes was paving over A-ball lineups even though he was using his fastball at a 70-80% clip. On the season, he used it 70% of the time and still struck out 32% of opponents. For further context, the average big league fastball generated a 23% miss rate in 2024, while Fuentes' was well above 30%. The two key developmental variables for Fuentes will be, first, proving that he can sustain this kind of performance across nearly twice the workload he's shown so far, and second, finding another good pitch. His slider is roughly average right now, while his changeup is well below. The slider sits about 83 mph and has below-average spin, but its two-plane shape pairs nicely with the exploding movement of Fuentes' fastball. The upside here is that Fuentes could be a Joe Ryan type of starter. He's still probably two or three years away from paydirt in Atlanta."
Luis Peralta,SIRP,COL,2025,,40+,Low,24.2,,,,,"Peralta looked like a perfectly fine lefty middle reliever in Pittsburgh's system before he enjoyed a substantial velo boost throughout the 2024 season, during which he was traded to Colorado at the deadline for Jalen Beeks. He sat 93 mph in 2023 and 94 during the bulk of 2024, then found another gear when he was promoted to the big club in late August and sat 94-97. 
Peralta hides the ball well and creates upshot angle on the pitch; if he can command it to the top of the zone more consistently, it should be a comfortably plus offering. Peralta's low-80s slider lacks raw spin, but it has still been a platoon-neutral weapon that generated a miss rate around 50% from both lefties and righties in 2024. If the velo spike sticks in 2025, he'll be one of Colorado's high-leverage options."
Carson Ragsdale,SP,SFG,2025,,40,Med,26.8,,,,,"Ragsdale finally had a healthy season in 2024, splitting 120.2 innings between Double- and Triple-A. He struck out 147, walked 57, and posted a 4.18 ERA, no small feat when you spend half the season in the PCL. Ragsdale's best pitch has long been his gorgeous overhand curveball, which has knee buckling depth. Ragsdale's 92-95 mph fastball and this curveball make up about 85% of his pitches, while he very occasionally works in an upper-80s cutter or changeup. Ragsdale has had trouble repeating his release (no surprise given his size) and has looked reliever-y at times, even though he's only ever been a starter. His fairly lengthy injury history, which kept him out most of 2022 and 2023, has also tended to pull his projection toward the bullpen. But coming off a complete 2024, it seems like he's in position to make his 2025 debut as a spot starter and, so long as he can stay healthy, entrench himself toward the back of San Francisco's rotation during the next couple of seasons."
Dante Nori,CF,PHI,2028,,40,High,20.5,45,40,30,70,"The combination of Nori's age (he was a high school prospect who turned 20 not long after the 2024 draft) and lack of projectability (he is built similarly to Sal Frelick) is a big part of why he wasn't prominently featured on my 2024 pre-draft rankings. His lack of body and power projection made it imperative that he develop a special hit tool to be an impact player, and most prospects for whom that is true end up in college, where they can more solidly demonstrate such an ability. Instead, Nori became something of a surprise first round pick and signed for $2.5 million. After the draft, the Phillies appropriately sent him straight to the Florida State League, where he played center field and got 66 plate appearances, with a handful more during postseason dev activity. 
Nori has some exciting catalytic qualities, namely his speed. He's a flat 70 runner and makes some of the fastest little strides in pro baseball. Though his feel for center field is a little unpolished, Nori has the wheels to be an impact glove out there at maturity. His offense is probably going to be a little lighter than that of most everyday center fielders, who tend to have some power. Nori's hitting hands work in such a way that it causes him to spray lots of oppo contact. He's going to pepper the gaps and the left field line with liners, and produce extra-base hits more with his legs than his power. Perhaps Nori's contact ability will be great enough for him to outpace this projection, but until there's more tangible evidence of that, he looks more like an extra outfielder."
Felix Arronde,SP,KCR,2026,,45,Med,21.9,,,,,"There are few pitchers in the minors with Arronde's combination of youth, projectability, and present strike-throwing ability, as he posted a 2.94 ERA in 110.1 innings at Low-A Columbia in 2024. As his stuff is currently constituted, Arronde is in position to be a strike-throwing backend starter. His fastball's lack of movement causes it to play down despite its velocity, but if Arronde can get stronger (especially in his lower body) and better explode down the mound, the ceiling on that pitch is pretty big. His breaking ball would benefit from more power, too. Arronde also has a promising splitter that often has slider shape and action. It's all over the place, but it moves late, and it moves a lot. Arronde didn't throw strikes until 2024. If he can do it again, and if the Royals can help him get stronger, he could be a Top 100 prospect in 2026."
Jackson Baumeister,SP,TBR,2026,,45,Med,22.7,,,,,"Baumeister came to Florida State with a lot of profile as a two-way high school prospect, but he ran an ERA over 5.00 in his two seasons there, though his FIP was 2.82 in 2023. Baumeister's uncommon athleticism and vertical fastball ride made him an early-round draft prospect anyway. The Orioles made him the 63rd overall pick in 2023 and sent him to High-A when camp broke in 2024. Though he was walk-prone there, he was still missing a ton of bats, and the Rays took him as part of the Zach Eflin trade return. Baumeister’s pitch usage changed after the trade, and he threw fewer curveballs and more of his 83-87 mph cutter/slider during the final month of the season. The change coincided with better overall strike-throwing from Baumeister, who cut his walk rate from 14% to 4.8% after the deal. 
Baumeister's delivery is pretty crunchy and creates a sort of relief risk on its own. He strides open and falls way off toward the first base side, and there's also some violence about the head and neck on release. His 92-95 mph four-seamer consistently rides above bats thanks to its carry through the zone. He doesn't locate it precisely, but he has feel for elevating it in general, which is fine considering its life. His curveball is a 12-to-6 downer with significant depth that tunnels well with his elevated four-seamers out of the hand. There’s also a fading changeup in the mix that Baumeister throws with good arm speed; his best ones have enough action to miss bats. Unless Baumeister's late-season strike-throwing improvement continues, this is a starter's mix in a reliever's mechanical and strike-throwing package. Baumeister is at least going to be a great multi-inning reliever and has a shot to be a good team's fourth starter."
Cris Rodriguez,RF,DET,2031,,45,High,17.2,40,40,60,40,"Perhaps the most physically impressive prospect in the 2025 international class, Rodriguez is built like a young Larry Fitzgerald and signed with the Tigers for a little more than $3 million. He became enormously strong over the year or so leading up to the 2025 signing day, and he puts on quite a show during BP. Rodriguez has plus power right now and is very likely grow into even more as he keeps filling out. His is a turbo-charged right field profile with enormous power and arm strength, akin to a high school player who would go in the mid-to-late first round of any given draft. His hit tool and contact ability garner mixed reviews from scouts, as his lever length and opposite-field tendency might be an issue against pro velo. A corner-only fit on defense combined with hit tool risk creates a low floor for the profile, but 30-plus homer upside exists if Rodriguez can actually hit. Tigers fans have heard this refrain before, as many of their recent high-profile signees are K-prone corner guys, but while Rodriguez shares this sort of risk, he has a different level of physical projection than the others."
Nazier Mule,SIRP,CHC,2027,,40+,High,20.5,,,,,"Mulé missed all of 2023 after having Tommy John surgery in March of that year, so 2024 was his professional debut. Mulé’s high caliber athleticism remains apparent, but his inability to throw strikes (17.9% walk rate) is the primary reason for his lackluster results over 52 frames between the complex and Myrtle Beach. Mulé’s quick arm produces a fastball that sits in the mid-90s right now, and he had more in the tank when working in short bursts in high school. Mulé still flashes the plus-plus slider that was mentioned in his write-up last year, but far too often its location is uncompetitive, or he gets on the side of it and it loses a degree of sharpness. His changeup will have notable depth and fade at its best, but his feel for landing it in the zone is still very much lacking (35% in-zone rate). Mulé looks bound for a single-inning relief role if he can keep his strike-throwing at a tenable level, with his elite athleticism and pure stuff offering a glimmer of hope for a leverage relief ceiling one day."
Slade Caldwell,CF,ARI,2028,,40+,Med,18.8,55,60,35,70,"Caldwell is a plus-plus running quarter stick of dynamite with the tools to be a turbo-charged leadoff man. Resembling the D-backs' outfielder draft pick prototype of recent years, Caldwell is a short player with catalytic offensive qualities who had superlative contact performance on the showcase circuit. He got just over $3 million to sign rather than go to Ole Miss, but didn't play at an affiliate after the draft. Caldwell is incredibly muscular and strong for a 5-foot-9 guy. His build is maxed out, in the Jasson Domínguez/Jett Williams area physically, where there's really nowhere to go except too big. Caldwell swings really hard, but had no discernible swing-and-miss issues in high school. He doesn't often make flush airborne contact, but he's dangerous against high fastballs and wreaks havoc with his speed when he makes lesser contact. Caldwell's ceiling is that of a leadoff-hitting everyday center fielder, though his mature physique creates some profile volatility."
Boston Baro,3B,NYM,2028,,40+,High,20.6,50,45,50,50,"Baro was a standout at the 2023 MLB Draft Combine and ended up getting $700,000 rather than head to UCLA. He slashed .278/.358/.390 at (mostly) Low-A St. Lucie in 2024. Baro has exciting physical projection for a lefty-hitting infielder, and is a heady and athletic third base defender with uncommon range and bend for such a tall guy. Especially if he ends up with a bit more arm strength as he fills out, he projects to be a special hot corner glove. On offense, Baro shows an ability to track pitches and use the whole field. His hands are sometimes a little late to fire, but as he gets stronger, he should be able to shorten up. He has a very exciting skill foundation with lots and lots of physical projection remaining, and responded to a somewhat aggressive assignment in 2024. He looks like a potential everyday third baseman."
Walbert Urena,SIRP,LAA,2026,,40+,High,21.2,,,,,"Urena remains a sushi raw strike-thrower who has walked a shade over six batters per nine throughout his three-year pro career. He generates upper-90s fastball velocity with comical ease for a pitcher who will only turn 21 during the 2024-25 offseason, but Urena's release is wildly inconsistent, which impacts the efficacy of his stuff. Urena sat 94-99 across the entire 2024 season and was holding that velocity during instructs in the fall. His slider (anywhere in the 81-87 mph range) and changeup (84-88) both flash plus movement on occasion, but Urena's lack of feel impacts their quality throughout his starts. None of his pitches generated a meaningfully good whiff rate in 2024 — Urena's profile is entirely dependent on him improving his control enough for his stuff to play, let alone enough for him to start. He has as much upside as the pitchers in the 40+ FV tier of the Angels system, arguably more because there are glimpses of three good pitches here, but he's also the most under-developed of the group and will probably take a while to make a case for a roster spot."
Jesus Rodriguez,3B,NYY,2026,,40+,High,22.9,50,50,45,30,"Rodriguez trekked slowly through the lower levels of the minors, much like Agustin Ramirez before him, posting well above-average offensive lines in rookie and A-ball. It culminated in a 2024 breakout that saw Rodriguez post a 160 wRC+ at High-A, though he came back to earth during his final 23 games at Double-A. 
Rodriguez plays all over the diamond and has experience at all the non-shortstop infield positions, catcher, and in left field. He is best at the corner infield spots and has a shot to be an above-average third baseman, but Rodriguez is incredibly raw at all facets of catching. Even though he was added to New York's 40-man after the 2024 season, he is still likely a multi-year defensive project as a catcher. The Yankees have helped guys with significant issues back there (Ramirez, Austin Wells) get their defense to a better, more viable spot. If Rodriguez can do the same, then he might hit enough to simply be a primary catcher. 
Rodriguez lets the ball travel deep into the hitting zone before making lots of well-struck opposite field contact. He might have issues with tardiness against upper-level velocity, but he only faced a couple dozen pitches of 94 mph or more in 2024, so we just don't know yet. Right now, Rodriguez has an average contact/power blend. A tendency to chase could make his hit tool slip against crafty, older arms, which is another thing to watch in 2025. There's still a fair bit of volatility in forecasting Rodriguez's offense, and he isn't an especially projectable athlete, but he's a good defensive third baseman, he might end up with special versatility, and he's looked like a pretty well-rounded and competent hitter so far. There are some Russell Martin-ish aspects to Rodriguez's profile (he'd have to get <em>so</em> much better on defense), and he has upside despite lacking big physical projection, be it as a primary catcher or top flight utilityman."
Jose Perdomo,3B,ATL,2030,,40+,Med,18.5,50,,55,40,"Perdomo got the biggest bonus in the 2024 international amateur class at a cool $5 million, the most ever by a Venezuelan player. Hamstring injuries limited him to just eight games during his would-be debut season. Of potential concern here is that my notes on amateur Perdomo featured comments on his general lower body stiffness. At the time, that was an indication that the physically mature infielder would have to move off of shortstop, but now that he's also had a severe soft tissue injury, his near-future health is of particular importance and focus. The good news is that Perdomo's swing looked pretty good during that tiny eight-game stretch; I was able to source roughly half of his 2024 in-game swings from ops personnel and, just as it was before he signed, you can see why the Braves gave him a multi-million dollar bag. 
We still don't truly know anything about Perdomo's purportedly precocious feel to hit, though. We do know the Braves seemingly intended to assign him to the FCL roster before the first hammy issue, an indication that they thought he was ready to compete a level above what is typical for a prospect his age. Perdomo still looks like a guy who will have to move off of shortstop and will end up at second or third base, but he has the power to be a relevant regular at either spot if it turns out he can actually hit. This is a slight downgrade from Perdomo's pre-signing eval because of the risk created by a) the recurring injuries and b) the lost season of reps because of them."
Zach Agnos,MIRP,COL,2025,,40+,Low,24.6,,,,,"A rock-solid two-way player at East Carolina and on Team USA, the mustachioed Agnos has focused on pitching in pro ball and has added nearly four ticks of velo to his fastball, which kept climbing throughout the entire 2024 season. He split the campaign evenly between High-A Spokane and Double-A Hartford, and ran a 1.38 ERA across 52.1 innings of relief. 
Agnos has the tools to deal with hitters of either handedness, hence his multi-inning projection. He attacks hitters at the belt with a 94-95 mph fastball that features plus vertical movement, and he gets them to go fishing below the zone with a heavy, sinking changeup in the 83-87 mph range. Agnos can vary the speed on his lateral breaking ball and present hitters with a low-90s cutter look or a two-planed mid-80s slider. The latter gets some play as a backfoot offering to lefties, but Agnos tends to mix both breaking balls in against righties. His command of everything is good enough to wonder whether he might fit in a rotation, but he's a squat guy with a fairly violent delivery, atypical of a starter in these ways. The 2025 season is Agnos' 40-man platform year, but if he pitches like he did in 2024, he'll probably be up before the end of the season."
Deyvison De Los Santos,DH,MIA,2025,,40+,High,21.8,35,40,60,30,"De Los Santos didn't play well enough during spring training to make the Guardians' 2024 roster as a Rule 5 Draft pick. He was sent back to the Diamondbacks, who later traded him to Miami as part of the A.J. Puk deal. De Los Santos has had plus-plus big league raw power since he was 19, but the rest of his game has been sushi raw. For basically his entire time as a prospect, including right now, De Los Santos' future has hinged on whether or not he'll get to enough power to support a lower-OBP first base profile. His selectivity at the plate and infield defense have ranged from “immature” to “god awful,” and the former was a big part of why he had a below-average all-around offensive season at Amarillo last year despite hitting 20 bombs. 
De Los Santos is kind of a freak, comparing physically to former NFL fullback Lorenzo Neal more than he does anyone else in baseball. He does not get cheated and swings as hard as he can at every opportunity. His slider recognition is awful; he chased them at a 49% clip in 2023, per Synergy. Christian Encarnacion-Strand has been a free-swinging canary in the coalmine for this kind of profile and things haven't gone especially well for him; a deeper look back at hitters of this ilk produces comps like Ryon Healy and C.J. Cron. De Los Santos is way more fun to watch swing and hit oppo bombs than that, but realistically, he's on a similar path."
Logan Henderson,SIRP,MIL,2025,,40+,High,23.1,,,,,"Henderson was a dominant junior college pitcher who punched 169 tickets in just 97 innings during his draft year. He has barely pitched in pro ball because the Brewers shut him down after he was drafted (which is pretty typical, especially in this org), he had a relatively minor elbow surgery early in 2022 that cost him most of the year, and further soreness nixed a planned Fall League stint at the end of that season. Henderson's 2023 got off to a delayed start to manage his innings, but he was dominant when he pitched. Across 18 starts at Low-A, including many second half starts of five or six innings, Henderson struck out 35% of opponents and had a 2.75 ERA. He did so despite sitting about 92 mph and using just two pitches, the other being his plus, screwball-style changeup. 
This spring, Henderson is throwing much harder, albeit in short outings. In his one Cactus League inning prior to publication, he was sitting 95-97. Context is important; Henderson is totally rested and worked just a single inning. But if Henderson is going to throw that hard for an inning at time, it could make sense to fast track him in relief since he might only be a reliever anyway. Henderson is a shorter guy with a high-effort delivery. He's thrown strikes as a pro, but he's also been hurt some and the look of his delivery is more typical in a bullpen. Then there's the issue of a third pitch, which Henderson is still searching for. He used an uphill cutter in 2023 but a source indicated to me that his breaking ball now has more slider shape in the 83-84 mph range. Whether or not that pitch is a hit this season might dictate which track Henderson ends up on, possibly by the middle of the year. His changeup is a pretty special pitch and, if paired with an uphill, mid-90s fastball for an inning at a time, is the sort of weapon you find on a higher-leverage reliever. I expect Henderson to be promoted very aggressively in 2024 because it's his 40-man evaluation year, and there's a chance it will make sense for Milwaukee to 'pen him late in the season and allow him to debut as a reliever in September without burning one of his options."
Mason Black,SP,SFG,2025,,40,Med,25.3,,,,,"Black made his big league debut in May of 2024, took a few turns in the rotation, and then was sent back to Sacramento until the very end of August, when he rejoined the big club for the rest of the season. He is just a few days shy of losing rookie eligibility. Black's stuff tends to live at the top of the strike zone and to his glove side; hitters can eliminate the low and arm-side quadrant of the zone when they face him, and that's largely why Black has a backend starter or long reliever grade. He's a low-slot slinger with a tailing, uphill low-90s fastball. Black will pepper the glove-side corner of the plate with a cutter and sweeper, and he tries to mix those against lefties and use his fastball as a chase pitch. He's got two option years left and will likely graduate as a spot starter before settling into a more permanent low-leverage role of some kind."
Josh Kuroda-Grauer,2B,ATH,2027,,40,Med,22.2,55,60,30,50,"Kuroda-Grauer was a great contact hitter at Rutgers, where he had a career .343/.419/.501 line with more walks than strikeouts as both a sophomore and junior. He signed for a little over $1 million as a 2024 third rounder and got a shot of espresso at Triple-A late in the summer after only 113 plate appearances between Low- and High-A. Kuroda-Grauer’s offensive profile is built around his advanced bat-to-ball chops, which were evident in his 126 plate-appearance pro debut, as he again walked more times (12) than he struck out (nine). Kuroda-Grauer is short to the ball with average bat speed. He has feel for manipulating the bat in the zone and tends to work toward the opposite field. 
On the defensive side, JKG does a lot of things commensurate with playing pro shortstop, save for his max-effort arm strength and accuracy. Kuroda-Grauer has a tendency to airmail throws when he either needs to hurry or really wing it over there. Conversely, his routine throws when he has time to get set are remarkably crisp and accurate. He controls his body well when ranging for balls, and has effortless and consistent actions around the bag. He’s not someone you want to play 100-plus games at shortstop, but he'd be fine there in case of an emergency, and we think Kuroda-Grauer will be a plus defender at second base. He'll need to develop either more power than we expect or special defensive versatility to outpace the infield utility grade we have here."
Bryan Rincon,SS,PHI,2026,,40,High,21.1,40,40,45,50,"After his breakout 2023, Rincon had a rough 2024 and was either injured (a hamstring injury cost him three months) or striking out way, way more than he was the season before. He K'd at a 25% clip at Low-A and a 31.4% rate at High-A. Rincon went to the Arizona Fall League after the regular season to pick up some of the reps he lost due to the hamstring injury and continued to struggle there. He was at or under the Mendoza Line all year when he was healthy enough to play. How much of this was rust, or related to discomfort and tightness that preceded the IL stint, and how much is related to Rincon's talent? His underlying contact rates dipped from 88% in-zone and 81% overall in 2023 to 81% in-zone and 74% overall in 2024. Rincon looked better at shortstop the further away he got from his hamstring injury, and was good there in the AFL, but the same was not true of his hitting hands, which were still a little slow and stiff. A year ago, it looked like Rincon would have the skill set of a Geraldo Perdomo type of second division regular. Now he's looking more like a lower-impact reserve whose best skill is his plate discipline."
Omar Cruz,MIRP,SDP,2025,,40,Low,26.2,,,,,"Cruz was traded to Pittsburgh in the Joe Musgrove deal, stalled out at Double-A Altoona, and was left unprotected in the minor league Rule 5 draft during last offseason. The Padres picked him and Cruz had a gigantic  leap in performance coming out of the San Antonio bullpen in 2024. His fastball velocity was up, more often in the 93-95 mph range with plus vertical ride. His changeup, which was always the cornerstone of his repertoire, remains excellent and played like a plus-plus pitch. He can change speeds on two different breaking balls and has retained the command he had as a starter. It just seems like Cruz is suited to work two innings at a time so he can have something approaching average velocity, and the rest of his repertoire is playing up as a result. His body looks better and more athletic than ever before and he dominated Double-A hitters. He's taken a circuitous route there, but Cruz looks like a changeup-driven long reliever."
Cooper Kinney,2B,TBR,2026,,45,Med,22.2,45,45,50,40,"Kinney was drafted as a big-framed bat-to-ball prospect with reverse projection, a forecast he has made good on, as he has slimmed down and become more agile than when he turned pro. At the time of his selection, it was thought that Kinney would play some combination of third and first base at maturity, but he's been successfully moved up the defensive spectrum and has become a viable (if unspectacular) second base defender, in addition to playing both corner infield positions. He enters 2025, his 40-man platform year, a career .280/.352/.432 hitter across parts of three minor league seasons, with a 2022 gap year in there due to a shoulder surgery. 
Kinney's bat path is in the hitting zone for a long time, allowing him to work the opposite field with doubles-quality contact, though it limits his ability to pull the baseball. He's a great low-ball hitter with some vulnerability at the top of the strike zone, which perhaps will worsen as Kinney deals with upper-level foes and their velocity. He should still hit enough to play a multi-positional role, but probably not an everyday one. Kinney does a little bit of everything and his versatility will aid in his rosterability, but he doesn't have a plus, game-changing tool, and so his impact is likely to be modest. With Tampa Bay's crowded infield and 40-man situation, Kinney is a potential trade candidate in 2025. "
Sawyer Gipson-Long,SP,DET,2025,,45,Med,27.3,,,,,"Acquired from Minnesota for Michael Fulmer, Gipson-Long has carved out a place on Detroit's 40-man roster and appeared poised to play either a spot start or long relief role in 2024 after making his debut in 2023. Instead, he had a groin issue, and then in his first rehab start from the groin, he blew out his elbow; he had TJ last April and hip surgery last July. He'll begin the season on the 60-day IL but should contribute to the big league club throughout 2025, with Detroit's starter depth perhaps making it more likely that SGL ends up in the bullpen, at least initially. 
Both Gipson-Long's changeup and slider are comfortably plus pitches, and they actually played a little better than that when he was last healthy. His changeup has ridiculous trapdoor action that allows it to work as a bat-misser against hitters of either handedness, and his cross-bodied delivery and low-three-quarters arm stroke makes his slider a nightmare for righties. There was a long stretch where Gipson-Long was only walking about 5% of opposing batters. On paper, that looks like high-end command, but the eyeball scouting report doesn't corroborate that, especially toward the end of 2023. Gipson-Long bullies hitters in the zone, but he doesn't have surgical touch-and-feel command, especially of his fastball. Hitters who struggle with low-slot righties aside, Gipson-Long's fastball is fairly hittable, especially once opponents get a feel for his delivery, and he has been rather homer-prone, especially since joining the Tigers org. This is why he might be best suited for long relief, where he can lean even more heavily on his secondary pitches and elevate his fastball. It means he'll be a less efficient strike-thrower, but that's fine in relief. Make no mistake, if SGL can return to full health, he is going to be an impact arm of some kind — his secondary stuff is too good for him not to be. Even in the bullpen, he warrants a pretty big FV grade here."
Juan Tomas,SS,CHC,2031,,40+,High,17.3,35,40,50,60,"Connected to the Marlins at an early point in the process, Tomas signed with the Cubs in January 2025 for $1.1 million. He has a long, skinny frame, and is a great athlete, but his swing is super raw. That extends to his defense at shortstop, too. There are scouts who think Tomas' righty swing is so raw that he should ditch it and just hit lefty. He's a prospect of extreme variance who could be enormously strong in his mid-20s."
JD Dix,SS,ARI,2029,,40+,Med,19.5,45,50,50,45,"The D-backs took Dix with the 35th overall pick in the 2024 draft out of Whitefish Bay High School in Wisconsin and gave him $2,150,000, which was just under slot, to skip his commitment to Wake Forest. Dix is a switch-hitter and features a more imposing swing from the left side, where he rotates more explosively, has better rhythm, and generates serious loft. His medium frame isn’t teeming with projection, but he is already quite strong and should add another half grade of power via physical maturity. Dix is a quick twitch athlete who has reliable hands on the dirt and the instincts to stay up the middle. He had multiple shoulder injuries in high school culminating in labrum surgery the fall before his senior year; whether he fully regains his solid arm strength long-term will be critical to whether he’s capable of handling short. He has a shot to be a power-hitting shortstop if he does."
Luinder Avila,SP,KCR,2025,,40+,High,23.6,,,,,"Avila is a lean, high-waisted righty who still has some projectability left on his frame. He throws from a high slot with a very lengthy arm circle that has a pronounced plunge and stab in its path, which has a tendency to hinder his overall command and the shape on his breaking ball. His four-seam fastball sits 92-95 mph as a starter (he was 94-96 in shorter bursts in the Fall League) with solid carry when it’s on the top rail of the zone, but he doesn't utilize the upper portion of the zone as often as most pitchers with a similar fastball shape. His 78-82 mph curveball has big velocity separation from his heater; the best ones are vertical downers with significant depth. The shape of the breaking ball will occasionally morph it into one that also has a hint of horizontal action, but it consistently maintains its bite. Avila's changeup is his least utilized pitch and the one that varies the most in quality. He'll flash a power (86-89 mph) cambio that has slight fade and depth and is capable of slipping under the bats of both left- and right-handed hitters, but it's still an offering that routinely lacks effective movement. 
Avila's command wasn't encouraging last year in Northwest Arkansas, but he's only 23 and has a track record of logging lots of innings, so it'd be premature to write him off as a starter. We're looking at a back-end starter ceiling, with Avila more likely to end up as a fastball/curveball combo reliever who could be a higher-leverage type if the stuff ticks up significantly in shorter bursts."
Clayton Beeter,SIRP,NYY,2025,,40+,Med,26.5,,,,,"Beeter spent most of his college career either injured or in the Texas Tech bullpen until he came out of the gate as a Red Raiders starter in 2020. Prior to the shutdown, he was not only electric, sitting in the mid-90s with two plus or better breaking balls, but he was also throwing strikes for the first time in his life. Beeter was developed as a walk-prone starter by the Dodgers and Yankees (he was traded for Joey Gallo) until late 2024, when, after returning from a three-month shoulder injury, he was finally moved to the bullpen. His stuff was great for the final month of the year. Beeter's uphill fastball averaged 95.4 mph, up three ticks from the period prior to his IL stint, including spring training. He also worked solely with his upper-80s slider as a secondary pitch. It has late, downward bite, and vertical shape that pairs nicely with the line on Beeter's heaters (a free phrase that pays for any HVAC company in the Tri-State area). His fastball's combination of velocity and riding life makes it a potential plus-plus offering, and his slider has rare velocity for a pitch that essentially has curveball shape. If Beeter can throw this hard for 50 innings or so, then he is going to have good enough stuff despite his below-average control to play a meaningful bullpen role, more than just a generic middle reliever."
Garrett Baumann,SP,ATL,2028,,40+,High,20.6,,,,,"Baumann was signed away from a UCF commitment for just shy of $750,000 and had a successful first full season in 2024, as he worked 99 innings (all but his final start came at Low-A) and carried a 3.18 ERA, 1.13 WHIP, and 21.9% K%. Most importantly, he held 93-95 fastball velocity all year, reinforcing the 6-foot-8 righty's innings-eating projection. Baumann throws a ton of strikes and utilizes a fastball-heavy approach, with most of his heaters living up and to the arm-side half of the plate. He is still searching for a dynamic second pitch. Both his slider and changeup, which tend to live in the mid-to-upper-80s, are below average right now. His ability to throw them for strikes is fairly advanced, but too often they're in places hitters can reach. His slider especially is often located like a cutter at the top of the zone. Baumann's overall ceiling is likely capped by a lack of natural secondary pitch quality, but I'm betting the changeup will progress enough to give him a second real weapon and enable Baumann to be more than just a generic backend guy, though probably not a star."
Seth Halvorsen,SIRP,COL,2025,,40+,High,25.1,,,,,"Halvorsen was a pretty serious two-way high school prospect (at least to play both at a high level in college — he was seen as probably just a pitcher in pro ball) who began his college career at Missouri, where he had Tommy John as a freshman early in 2019. During the early part of his return from TJ as a sophomore, Halvorsen played center field for the few weeks before the pandemic shutdown. He was exclusively a starting pitcher in 2021, then transferred from Missouri to Tennessee and transitioned to a multi-inning relief role in 2022. There have been a few key adjustments to Halvorsen's pitch mix along the way. He was fastball/curveball guy at Mizzou, threw more of a new splitter at Tennessee, and now he's throwing a few ticks harder than in college and has added a slider. He raced through the minors and was in Denver just over a year after he was drafted, notching 11 scoreless outings in 12 September games. 
All three of Halvorsen's pitches can be nasty. Because he lacks precise command, both of his secondary pitches have a tendency to finish all over the place. His slider, which averaged 88 mph during Halvorsen's big league trial, is hard enough to miss the barrel even when it backs up, and some of his mis-released splitters act like two-seamers running off the front hip of lefties and catching the corner. Fernando Cruz, Scott McGough and Erik Swanson are fair present comps for the way Halvorsen is likely to operate, with his pitch usage spread across his whole mix so that unpredictability can help him get away with his mistake locations. He profiles as the third- or fourth-best reliever in a good bullpen, one who has experience getting more than just three outs and who has the pitch mix to do so."
Sabin Ceballos,3B,SFG,2026,,40,Med,22.6,45,40,40,40,"Ceballos was a high-profile amateur because of his undersized linebacker's build and huge arm, which Perfect Game touted as having among the highest measured infield throwing velocities ever at PG National. Ceballos began his college career at San Jacinto Junior College in Texas and was drafted in the 14th round as a sophomore by the Angels (he didn't sign) before transferring to Oregon for his junior year. In Eugene, Ceballos hit .333/.426/.643, accrued nearly as many walks as strikeouts, and had a great collegiate postseason; the Braves popped him 11 rounds sooner in 2023 than he had been taken the year before. Ceballos had a .707 OPS with three home runs during the first half of 2024 at High-A Rome, and then was traded to San Francisco as part of the Jorge Soler deadline deal. The change in offensive environment helped facilitate a second-half breakout, as Ceballos hit .295/.364/.549 and clubbed seven homers in 32 games. 
Ceballos' skill set is headlined by his plus defensive actions and his huge arm. A balanced, low-to-the-ground athlete with great footwork, he has a strong, accurate arm from all kinds of odd platforms. His athletic style is more about body control than explosion, and this also applies to Ceballos' offense, which is driven by plate discipline and a compact swing. His contact data is a hair above the big league average (9% swinging strike rate, 84% in-zone contact). Though some of his best cuts look rather explosive, with Ceballos' bat finishing in the dirt behind him, he doesn't have the high-end raw power typical of a corner infielder. He'll need a combination of contact and OBP skill sufficient to clear the offensive bar of an everyday third baseman, which is plausible but unlikely. Because he isn't a speedy, up-the-middle athlete, it's tough to project Sabin as a utility guy. He projects to be a Matt Duffy type of big league corner infielder."
Edgar Montero,SS,ATH,2030,,40,High,18.4,50,50,50,40,"International scouts generally saw Montero, who signed for $1.2 million in January of 2024 and looks like is no longer switch-hitting, as having a pretty stable hit/power combination, though they also thought that once his lanky, 6-foot-2 frame filled out, he'd be a better fit at either second or third base than shortstop. He posted a fine .239/.398/.375 line in his DSL debut, managing average contact rates and plus plate discipline. Perhaps most importantly, he looked like a more skillful and rangy shortstop defender than his pre-signing reports. Montero was also one of the more physically projectable DSL Athletics. He continues to have a good foundation of tools, skills, and the potential for growth as his body matures."
Juan Flores,C,LAA,2028,,40,Med,19.1,35,40,30,20,"Flores is a skillful young defender whose offensive ceiling will likely be capped by his lack of size and his tendency to chase. He has some pull power but is much more likely to have a career as a glove-first backup than as a primary catcher. Flores is an unbelievably skilled thrower of the baseball. He has fairly average raw arm strength, but the quickness of his exchange and his ability to turn around poorly located pitches with pace and accuracy is remarkable. Flores' hands are also an asset when picking pitches in the dirt. He's a smaller athlete who needs to get stronger so his receiving can be quieter, but the other aspects of his defense are already very advanced and he projects as a plus defender with a plus arm. 
On offense, Flores is best when he gets something up and in that he can turn on. He is otherwise not a very dynamic or patient hitter. He's a compact athlete without a ton of physical projection and is unlikely to add much strength or power. He's ahead of the typical promotion pace for a teenager, but likely won't fight for a big league roster spot until 2028 or 2029."
Mick Abel,SIRP,PHI,2025,,40,High,23.6,,,,,"Abel hasn't developed as I hoped he would when he was drafted as a prototypical prep pitcher with upper-90s arm strength and two potential plus secondary pitches. He's posted double-digit walk rates at each minor league stop and regressed on that score in 2024, when he labored through a 15% mark at Triple-A. There are still starter components here. The arm-side action of Abel's curveball gives it utility against lefties, and his best sliders are 87-90 mph darts. Abel's fastball velocity still peaks in the upper-90s, but it doesn't sustain there, and his command and lack of explosive movement cause it to play down. He also has very little feel for locating his changeup, or really any of his offerings with any consistency. These have been Abel's issues for several years now. 
Now Abel's option clock has started and he only has so much time to polish his strike-throwing before the Phillies will be forced to put him in the bullpen, or do something else, like trade him to a franchise that has the time and opportunity to keep developing him as a starter; the ""win now"" Phils are less likely to have that luxury. If we can reasonably project Abel to have a velo spike with a shift to relief, then he should have the stuff to pitch toward the back of a bullpen even if he's never able to start. That said, he probably still needs to develop another grade of command in order to be trusted in such a role."
Noah Cameron,SP,KCR,2025,,45,Low,25.7,,,,,"Cameron was drafted in the seventh round of the 2021 draft out of Central Arkansas not long after he had a Tommy John surgery. 2023 was his first full season and he had an encouraging debut despite a 5.28 ERA. Over 107.1 innings of work, he fanned 28.3% of batters, walked 7.5% and reached Double-A. Cameron is prone to the long ball — he allowed 19 homers in 2023 (1.6 per 9 IP), most of which came against his 90-94 mph fastball. It’s a fringy heater that has a hint of downhill angle from his over-the-top slot and is dependent on being well-located to be effective. The best pitch in Cameron’s mix is his late-sinking changeup, which he sells by mimicking his fastball's arm speed. Cameron also has an 80-84 mph curveball. He manipulates its shape while consistently maintaining its sharp break. Despite being light on velocity, it’s looking like Cameron will have enough command to tiptoe around the zone with his heater and lean heavily on his high-quality secondary combo. He projects in a back-of-the-rotation role as long as his command continues to pass the stress tests presented by upper-level hitters."
Dominic Keegan,1B,TBR,2027,,45,Med,24.7,40,40,50,30,"Keegan only caught 32 games throughout his four-year Vanderbilt career, but his most likely path to being an impact player when he was drafted seemed to be via a return to catching full-time. Aside from a handful of games at first base in 2023, the Rays have deployed Keegan exclusively behind the plate in pro ball, and he's caught about 80 games each of the last two seasons. Unfortunately, he struggles with pitch framing and ball-blocking enough to conclude that it's unlikely he will stick behind the plate long-term. 
The good news is that Keegan has performed well enough on offense to have prospect relevance even if he has to move back to first base. He slashed .285/.371/.435 at Double-A Montgomery in 2024 and is a career .288/.380/.457 hitter in the minors. Most of Keegan's underlying Statcast-style hitting data is near the big league average at first base, with his contact ability being the one aspect of his offense that falls short. Given that Keegan has produced this way as a catcher, with his body taking a beating in part because he's such a butcher, is it possible his bat would have another gear if he were just a clean-jersey'd first baseman? That's plausible, but there is one other aspect of Keegan's hitting that could give one pause: He's basically never on time to pull fastballs. You can count on one hand the number of left-of-center-field hits Keegan had against heaters in 2024. It's a sign he might struggle against big league velocity if he's barely on time against Double-A offerings. The 2025 season is Keegan's 40-man platform year, and it will be interesting to see how the Rays handle his development on defense as he tries to make a case for a roster spot."
Maximo Acosta,SS,MIA,2026,,45,Med,22.4,55,55,40,45,"Acosta was perhaps one of the most improved statistical improvers in the minors in 2024, as he cut his strikeout rate by eight percentages points even though he was promoted to Double-A as a 21-year-old. He posted a 21% K% in 2023 (as well as a below-average offensive line overall), and then a 13% K% in 2024 and a career-best 119 wRC+. Acosta's gap-to-gap approach thrived at Frisco, where he had 33 extra-base hits and 26 stolen bases. 
Acosta's above-average ability to parse balls and strikes adds a meaningful dimension to his offense; his 24% chase rate is better than average and he remarkably maintained a 26% chase rate with two strikes. Most hitters show a much more significant split than that, but Acosta seems to have steely nerves with two strikes. Aside from his raw power, every other aspect of Acosta's skill set as a hitter is average or above. 
He finished his year in the Arizona Fall League, where he looked better at shortstop than in years past. His release is quick enough to make up for merely average arm strength, and Acosta often delivers the ball accurately and on time even when he has to make a tough, rushed play. Perhaps because he got to play the Robin to Alejandro Osuna's Fall League Batman, Acosta also seemed to hit a different competitive gear in Arizona and was one of the circuit's most engaged and outwardly competitive players for all six weeks. He may not have the power to be an everyday shortstop, but Acosta has begun to look like a luxury utilityman."
Abdias De La Cruz,RF,ARI,2028,,40+,High,20.4,50,45,50,60,"The lowest levels of the Diamondbacks' system have been flush with big-framed, projectable athletes recently, and De La Cruz is arguably the most well-made of the bunch. He is built like Michael Irvin and has an enormous power ceiling if he fills out the way we think he will. In 2024, when he moved from the infield to the outfield, De La Cruz slashed .301/.399/.435 with 32 walks (14.3%) and 46 strikeouts (20.5%) over 224 complex-level plate appearances, but he didn't hit a single homer. Despite his lever length, De La Cruz is fairly adept at staying short to the inner third of the zone and making contact in there, though he often strides toward the third base line in order to do this and might be vulnerable to well-located sliders as he climbs. His swing generates all-fields spray, including a lot of inside-outed contact to right field. For such a lanky hitter, this sort of performance is atypical. De La Cruz's power needs to start showing up in games because he's likely ticketed for a corner outfield spot. There are too many good center fielders in the org for him to get regular reps there, and he's new to the outfield and predictably raw. A long-term prospect because of his long-term power projection, De La Cruz has the look and feel of a toolsy junior college prospect who gets drafted in the third or fourth round."
Eric Reyzelman ,SIRP,NYY,2025,,40+,Med,23.8,,,,,"It was so tough to make Reyzelman's high school baseball team that he was cut a couple of times and had a Division-I offer before he could make the squad; when he finally did make the team, he was only ever used as a reliever. Reyzelman then played a swingman role at the University of San Francisco during his first two years of college. He also had a TJ during that time, from which he returned in less than a year. Reyzelman transferred to LSU for his draft year and had success as a fastball-only reliever. Not fastball-heavy, fastball-only — he threw something like 95% fastballs at LSU. 
After he was drafted, Reyzelman began to feel back pain. It took a while to diagnose (it was a cyst in his lower back) and even longer to remedy, as it required three surgeries to fix and then deal with a subsequent infection. He missed basically all of 2023 and didn't establish himself at an affiliate until June 2024, but once he did, it was like Reyzelman was shot out of a cannon. He dominated High-A and was quickly promoted to Somerset. His line in half a season: 38.2 IP, 18 H, 19 BB, 0.96 WHIP, 63 K. More importantly, Reyzelman showed he's a totally different pitcher. He now has two good secondary pitches in addition to his 94-98 mph fastball. His 82-85 mph slider has plus-plus spin and tight lateral movement, while his changeup at times features 20 inches of horizontal break. Both produced huge rates of miss and chase in his first year of using them regularly. Reyzelman is tracking like an impact reliever with three plus or better pitches. He's a potential setup man, especially if the secondary pitches keep improving."
Blake Burkhalter,SIRP,ATL,2026,,40+,Med,24.5,,,,,"Burkhalter had a velocity swoon in April of his draft year and dealt with a stretch where his heater only sat about 92 mph. It ramped up again late in the season and peaked during the 2022 College World Series, when he was bumping 97, tilting in a hellacious cutter as hard as 92 mph, and also missing bats with the occasional changeup. While his violent delivery pushed his projection toward the bullpen, Burkhalter's repertoire depth gave him a shot to start and his stuff seemed to be improving as the draft approached. Burkhalter was electric in his lone 2023 Grapefruit League appearance (up to 97, with nasty upper-80s cutters that had more depth when Burkhalter wanted it), but his final fastball was three ticks slower then his first one, and just two weeks later, the Braves announced Burkhalter needed Tommy John. He returned in mid-2024 (the attached video is from his second rehab outing), and by the end of the season, he had made 14 High-A starts, pitched 72 total innings, and posted a 1.21  WHIP and 23.6% K%. 
At his best, Burkhalter sat 95-96, touched 98, and commanded the same 92 mph cutter/slider from before his elbow blew. As he stretched out as a starter at Rome, Burkhalter's fastball velocity was more in the 92-96 mph range and he used more cutters. He was still often a first-pitch fastball guy but became unpredictable after that. His full-body, high-effort delivery is still evocative of a likely reliever, and that's how he's projected here, but Burkhalter's repertoire depth (his changeup is ahead of his curveball) is sufficient to continue starter development, if only to give him more reps with his secondary stuff. The 2025 season is Burkhalter's 40-man platform year and it's plausible Atlanta could decide to fast track him as a reliever in the mid-to-late part of the season. He's more likely to debut in 2026."
Juan Mejia,SIRP,COL,2025,,40+,Med,24.7,,,,,"Mejia spent his first year on the 40-man roster entirely at Double-A Hartford, where he ran a 5.00 ERA but a 3.50-ish FIP and xFIP. Mejia has one of the more explosive and athletic deliveries in the minors, as well as an ideal pitcher's frame at a lanky, broad-shouldered 6-foot-3. Mejia's velocity has climbed into the upper 90s across the last couple of seasons, and he tends to coast in the 95-97 mph range with peaks around 100. The movement on his heater is lacking, and it played more like an average offering in 2024. The same is true of Mejia's slider, though that pitch is more overtly nasty and instead underperformed because of Mejia's poor command. Mejia's delivery is almost too powerful for him to wrangle, and his release consistency suffers as a result. His ceiling as a reliever will be dictated by whether or not he can polish this part of his game. This is a relatively bullish projection, but Mejia is too freaky to slide even though he had an underwhelming 2024."
Hao-Yu Lee,2B,DET,2025,,40+,Med,22.2,40,40,50,30,"In the three full seasons since the Phillies signed him out of Taiwan for $570,000, the fire hydrant-shaped Lee has yet to play 100 games in a season, and the lumbar spine issue that ended his breakout 2024 campaign in mid-August has echoes of the significant lower back injury that the 22-year-old dealt with in high school. Before that specter descended upon him, Lee torched Double-A pitching to the tune of a .298/.363/.488 batting line, and he isn't allergic to hustle doubles or action on the basepaths (16 of 17 on steals) despite 40-grade run times. The footspeed is a hindrance to projecting him as a league average defender at the keystone, but Lee’s arm is strong enough to finish the plays at the end of his range, which has also enabled him to dabble at third base during his time in big league camp this spring.
While he murdered sliders last year, more intriguing than the surface-level results were the signs that Lee had started to address his anemic 2023 performance against velocity, which drove the more bearish earlier projections for him here. Despite having the bat speed to post plus exit velocities, a particular skill for avoiding expanding the zone, and a shorter stride with two strikes, the way Lee’s hips aggressively pull open to the third base side has produced unusual batted ball results for a short guy regularly taking big hacks at fastballs all over the zone. Lee has steadily opened his stance over the past year, which has made for a less extreme journey to a similar landing spot, but he’s still missing heaters at an average rate and he hasn't even been exposed to a lot of big league-caliber velocity and action yet. Even with the improvements, it’s still a relatively rare sight to see Lee drive velocity in the air to the pull side, and a lot of inside-out swings stand in the way of him putting as many balls over the fence as a 104 mph 90th-percentile exit velocity would suggest he should. 
Middle infielders who mash in the Eastern League in their age-21 season get lots of attention for a reason, but Lee’s swing path prompts questions about his outer-half plate coverage against well-commanded velocity, and his glove won't make him more than a reserve infielder with thump until he answers them."
Pablo Aliendo,C,CHC,2025,,40,High,23.8,35,40,45,40,"Aliendo is an athletic and angular catcher with an enormous arm and above-average pull power. He has an absolute hose, often popping sub-1.90 seconds on throws to second base and doing so with accuracy. His receiving and ball-blocking have long been way behind his arm, but they're starting to catch up, especially the receiving and framing. Aliendo's strikeout issues (over 30% K% in two years at Tennessee) are so bad that he can't be a primary catcher despite rare power for the position. He'll run into a few mistakes down the middle of the plate, but he's a bottom of the scale contact hitter. He's as allergic to sliders as a homeschooled zoomer is to nuts, missing them at a 47% rate. It caps his ceiling to a backup role, and Aliendo still needs some polish on defense to get there, which this FV grade expects he'll add."
Anthony Marquez,SS,SFG,2029,,40,High,18.5,55,60,30,60,"Marquez was the most dynamic athlete among San Francisco's DSL group in 2024. He's a lock shortstop defender with a beautiful right-handed swing. He tracks pitches well, his hands are deft and move the barrel around, he rotates well, and he's a plus runner. But Marquez is still so skinny that he's one of those prospects whose jersey wears him. He has such exciting skills, but he needs to get much, much stronger to even compete with upper-level minor leaguers, let alone big leaguers. The yawning chasm between his current strength and what he needs to develop to get to The Show is why he's in this FV tier and not the 40+ group."
Ayden Johnson,3B,ATH,2031,,40,High,17.1,40,45,55,50,"Johnson is the best Bahamian prospect in the 2025 international class. A physically mature, powerfully built youngster, he has the look of a D-I running back prospect. He works out at shortstop, but at his size, he's a pretty good bet to move to third base. Johnson has precocious power; he lacks big physical projection but already has meaningful pop. His bat path is vertical, and he has a good chance to actualize in-game power. Johnson can awkwardly roll over his feet and ankles and lose balance in the box; scouts are mixed in their hit tool projection for him. Johnson is a volatile but talented power-hitting infield prospect on par with a mid-second rounder. He signed for $1.5 million in January 2025."
Dylan Jordan,SP,LAA,2030,,40,High,19.5,,,,,"Jordan was signed away from a Florida State commitment for about $1.25 million. Analytically inclined teams have frequently pursued pitchers of his ilk, but this is a bit of a departure for the Angels. Jordan has a drop-and-drive delivery, and a low, slinger's arm slot. He bears some mechanical resemblance to Zack Wheeler, and creates nasty rise/run action that crowds the hands of righty batters. Off of that Jordan throws a two-plane sweeper-style breaking ball in the 77-82 mph range. He's not as projectable as most high school pitchers, but he isn't maxed out, either, and it's possible he'll add velocity as he matures, though via better conditioning rather than from him filling out. It can be tough for pitchers with deliveries like this to find a distinct third pitch, and that's what the Angels will attempt to develop. This is an exciting, high-variance prospect whose acquisition signals something of a stylistic adjustment on the Angels' part, while also continuing their trend of adding over-slot high school pitchers later in the draft."
Gabriel Rincones Jr.,LF,PHI,2027,,40,Med,24.1,35,30,50,40,"Rincones' father pitched briefly in the Mariners system before an injury derailed his career. His family moved to Venezuela and then later to Scotland for his dad's new job in the oil industry. Rincones would eventually find his way to prospect factory Plant High School in Florida (the alma mater of Tuckers Preston and Kyle), where he would initially struggle to make the team before establishing himself as a junior college prospect. He then spent two seasons at St. Petersburg College before transferring to FAU, where in just one season he slashed .346/.451/.658, hit 19 homers, and elevated his stock into the third round of the draft. 
Rincones, a career .250/.349/.436 pro hitter who spent the healthy chunk of his 2024 season at Reading, has missed quite a bit of time due to injury in two out of the last three years. He didn't play pro ball after the 2022 draft because of a shoulder injury, and he missed two months of 2024 due to a torn right thumb ligament. Rincones showed no ill effects from the thumb issue when he returned. He was second in the Phillies org in hard-hit rate (53%) behind Kyle Schwarber and totaled 28 extra-base hits in 68 games. Rincones has plus left-handed power, but he struggles too much with secondary stuff to consider him a lock to be a suitable 400 PA platoon guy. Rincones' limited amateur baseball reps and his time missed due to injuries leave room for him to improve a bit into his mid-20s, enough to be a lesser option of this sort."
Santiago Suarez,SP,TBR,2027,,45,Med,20.2,,,,,"Suarez has been on the prospect radar since he pitched 39 very efficient innings in the 2022 DSL with Miami, then was traded to Tampa Bay in an offseason 40-man crunch deal for Xavier Edwards. His velocity has been steadily climbing since then. He sat 90-94 in 2023 and then was in the 93-96 mph range in 2024, including toward the end of the year after Suarez had worked nearly twice as many innings as he had the prior season. You need a magnifying glass to see Suarez's walk rate, which has been in the 3-5% range his entire career; he's never had a BB/9 IP above 1.82 or a WHIP over 1.22 at any minor league level. 
Suarez's fastball punches above its weight thanks to its plus riding life and Suarez's ability to command it to effective locations. It has 18 inches of induced vertical break from a slightly lower than average release height. Off of that he deploys a lot of cutters and sliders. The cutter is usually in the 87-91 mph range, while the slider is a two-plane offering in the 78-84 mph range, and he can manipulate it into a curveball shape. His secondary stuff isn't especially nasty, but Suarez tends to locate it it in the right spot. He perhaps isn't the athlete that Joe Ryan is, but he otherwise shares a number of similarities with him. He has fastball-heavy no. 4 starter upside and a very high floor because of his command."
Druw Jones,CF,ARI,2026,,40+,High,21.3,30,30,45,55,"Various injuries (a post-draft labrum tear, and quad and hamstring issues the following year) prevented Jones from being healthy enough to play consistently until 2024, when he hit .275/.409/.405 to go with a 28% strikeout rate and 18% walk rate in 109 Cal League games. It's good that Jones was actually able to play, stayed off the IL all year, and had a productive surface-level performance, which was good for a 125 wRC+. But Jones still has some pretty serious issues hitting. He remains wholly unable to pull the baseball due to the length of his swing. When Jones was in high school, this seemed like a quirk that could be ironed out in pro ball; instead, it has turned into a concerning issue. Jones is often overwhelmed by fastballs because he's too late to the contact point, and even when he's not, he often drives the ball into the ground. Jones posted a 57.2% groundball rate in 2024, which would have tied for the eighth-highest GB% among big league hitters with 100 PA. 
Before he was drafted, it was reasonably assumed that Jones would be able to shorten up his swing as he filled out and got stronger, but that hasn't happened. Though he had a softer, less sinewy build than most elite high school-aged prospects, he was a big-framed guy who was already hitting the ball really hard for his age. It seemed like he might suddenly have enormous power and a more functional swing on a pro strength program, but he has been treading water in these areas. Of course, even though Jones had a healthy 2024, he's still missed the majority of his potential pro at-bats due to injury, which might explain why all of this stuff is so far behind. We can all cross our fingers that this is true, but it doesn't change the reality of Jones' scouting report right now; he has a huge hole in his swing at the top of the zone. 
He remains a good defensive center fielder, especially at the catch point. Jones does some ridiculous stuff adjusting and contorting his body to make spectacular plays, though his range and route quality are more average, and are sometimes why he's forced to do Spiderman stuff. All is not lost here, but at age 21, there are so many aspects of Jones' game that need to develop that it'd be unreasonable to expect that all of them will. A hopeful but level-headed projection for him at this point is a career like Michael A. Taylor's, where Jones gets to enough power and plays great enough defense to have a long career as a fourth outfielder with a season or two peaking above that."
Roderick Arias,SS,NYY,2029,,40+,High,20.6,30,30,50,50,"Two of Arias' three seasons have now yielded terrifying strikeout rates, and the one that didn't was shortened to 27 games by injury and probably isn't a reliable sample. It's usually damning when a player K's north of 30% of the time at the lowest levels, which is what Arias did in the 2022 DSL and again at Low-A Tampa in 2024. He has also backpedaled on defense, where his lackluster range turns ordinary plays into difficult ones. Arias has a big arm, which covers up for some of these issues, and in prior seasons he looked like a lock to stay at short. He has some bounce back potential in this area. There is also still enormous lefty bat speed here. Arias desperately needs to show bat-to-ball improvement in 2025, but he can have a below-average hit tool at maturity and still be a good player if he has the kind of power I think he will. There's now a thick cloud of bust risk hanging over Arias' profile, but his potential upside remains the same."
Raudy Reyes,SIRP,ATL,2031,,40+,High,16.6,,,,,"Among the later commits from the 2025 international class was Reyes, who signed with Atlanta for just shy of $1.8 million, which is a ton for a pitcher in that market. Reyes is a physically mature righty who was touching 100 before he turned 16; he has been up to 101. His fastball has real carry and vertical shape, while his slider is plus and has plus velocity. Reyes has not been able to throw strikes in workouts. He has late-inning relief upside if he can maintain his peak stuff across an actual season of innings and polish his command. 
There's a chance Reyes will be pushed faster than the other players in his signing class if things click for him from a strike-throwing standpoint. Usually signees from the D.R. are sitting in the low-90s at best at this stage, and velocity comes with time and development. Because Reyes' arm strength is already exceptional, there's simply less to wait for. The 2026 season is probably when Reyes could first conceivably take a multi-level leap, since most international signees tend to spend their first season in the DSL to participate in non-baseball classroom learning, and for tax purposes."
Welinton Herrera,SIRP,COL,2026,,40+,High,21,,,,,"A slender, 6-foot tall pure reliever, Herrera spent three years in rookie ball and then exploded in 2024 as he split his season between both A-ball levels, totaling 62.1 innings in 46 games while striking out 92 and allowing just 80 baserunners. His fastball averaged about 94.5 mph during the regular season, but was 95-98 for me during Instructional League and 94-97 in the Dominican Winter League with Aguilas. 
Herrera's drop-and-drive delivery and three-quarters slot combine to create uphill angle on his fastball, making it very tough for hitters to get on top of it when he's sitting 96-plus; that pitch had an absurd 42% miss rate in 2024. In order to hit his ceiling as a set-up man or closer, Herrera will need to improve at least one of his secondary pitches. His slider was in the 82-84 mph range during the 2024 season and instructs, but has been up in the 86-88 mph range in LIDOM, where it still lacks the finish and depth of a great slider. His changeup, often in the 87-90 mph range, tends to cut on him and finishes in vulnerable locations. Herrera's long arm swing makes it tough to project a ton on his changeup, but even if his fastball ends up being his only impact offering, it's going to be good enough for Herrera to be more than just a generic middle reliever. He's a candidate for quick promotion in 2025 and is likely to be put on the 40-man after the season."
Tyler Mattison,SIRP,DET,2025,,40+,Med,25.6,,,,,"Mattison had a breakout 2023, as he added two and a half ticks to his fastball and was sitting 94-96 mph rather than just peaking in that range. Mattison's fastball has always punched above its weight because of its carry and his deceptive delivery, but now it's also fast, giving him three bat-missing offerings. Mattison also has a vertical curveball that sometimes has some arm-side movement, which makes it a weapon against both lefties and righties. He still only uses his tailing mid-80s changeup occasionally, but that pitch had an absurd miss rate against lefties in 2023, north of 50%. The leap in Mattison's velo, repertoire depth, and ability to attack hitters of either handedness makes him more exciting that most middle relief prospects. He had TJ in March of 2024 and missed the whole season, but was still added to the 40-man roster this winter. He is expected to return sometime in the first half of the season, per <em>The Detroit Free Press</em>."
Christian Franklin,CF,CHC,2025,,40,Med,25.3,50,40,40,50,"Franklin has made steady progress the last two seasons as he's come off a torn patellar tendon. He's capable of playing all three outfield spots (he's plus in the corners), he doesn't give away at-bats, he hits the ball hard (though often on the ground), and he plays with great effort and motor. Because none of his tools are plus, Franklin is a classic tweener outfielder. He hits with his feet very close together, and his swing is handsy, geared for low-ball contact, and produces an extreme opposite field fly ball tendency. Though Franklin's hands are authoritative and his hard-hit rate (41%) is above-average, he probably won't hit for much power with this swing, which makes him an OBP-driven fifth outfield type who is fine to roster and give 125-150 PA to against lefties and sinkerballers."
Trent Harris,SIRP,SFG,2026,,40,Med,26.2,,,,,"Harris is a former two-way player at UNC Pembroke who kissed Double-A in his first full pro season. He had 105 strikeouts in 79.2 innings of long relief and carried a 1.81 ERA. Harris has a drop-and-drive style delivery with a due north arm slot, which he gets to via tilt in his upper body. It creates natural cut and ride on his mid-90s fastball, which has hovered in the 94-96 mph range since Harris entered pro ball. Off of that he works two breaking balls — a curveball and a slider — which each have subtlety different lateral movement, but mostly downward depth. These breakers flash plus at times, but are easy to spot out of Harris' hand at others. His breaking ball results were closer to average in 2024; neither of them is dominant. Harris has also worked with a splitter, though it's an afterthought in terms of its present usage. Because we're talking about a guy who was a two-way player until after the 2023 draft, there is perhaps space to dream on this splitter improving through reps. Barring that happening to a large degree, however, Harris looks more like a standard middle inning option than a potential high-leverage one."
Shotaro Morii,TWP,ATH,2031,,40,High,18.3,45,45,50,45,"Morii comes out of Toho High School in Tokyo and elected to skip the NPB Draft (which was held late in 2024) to come stateside as an amateur prospect. This is similar (but meaningfully different) than Rintaro Sasaki skipping the NPB Draft to go to Stanford and eventually be subject to the MLB Draft, though it sounds like Morii considered an NCAA path. Morii's agreement with the A's was first reported by a Yahoo! Japan writer. Morii is a viable prospect on both sides of the ball. He has pretty electric hands in the batter's box and has been up to 95 mph on the mound. He lacks great lateral range and might be a better fit at second or third than shortstop. Though Morii is older than the rest of the class, he's likely a slower developmental burn as the A's figure out which side of the ball he fits best on. He signed for $1.5 million in January 2025."
Dario Laverde,C,LAA,2027,,40,High,20.1,45,55,45,20,"Laverde is an exciting bat-first catching prospect who split time between the Angels' Low-A and complex-level teams early in 2024 before entrenching himself at Inland Empire in the second half. Combined between the two levels, Laverde slashed .294/.371/.406 with 22 extra-base hits in 75 games. There are other position player prospects who have a better chance to remain at their up-the-middle position than Laverde, but one could argue Laverde has more offensive potential by a good bit. He has plus lefty bat speed with natural pull-side loft and enough barrel control to manifest that power in games. His stocky build lacks great long-term physical projection (Omar Narváez and Tucker Barnhart are pretty good body comps), but Laverde already has good offensive tools for a catching prospect. 
His arm strength is fine, but his accuracy, receiving, ball-blocking, and some of the other more subtle aspects of catching (Laverde's posture and early crouch often tip what pitch type is coming) will have to develop if he is going to stick behind the plate. All of that stuff is below average but not so bad that he's less than a 50/50 chance to stay back there; his foundation as a defender is strong enough to project him to remain at catcher. As is always the case with teenage catchers, Laverde is a risky prospect who will likely take a while to develop. His ultimate upside is as a bat-first catcher in the Narváez or Victor Caratini mold."
Leandro Pineda,RF,PHI,2027,,40,Med,22.8,40,40,50,40,"Pineda is a big-framed lefty power bat with good pull-side power against middle-in pitches. He has some oppo ability against pitches middle-away, but really struggles to cover the top of the strike zone. He hit .260/.331/.413 in 2024, including a successful trial with Reading at the very end of the season. Pineda's power isn't monstrous; instead, it's solidly average and projects above as his statuesque 6-foot-3 frame continues to fill out. He began playing first base in 2024 and has continued to get reps there in Venezuela this winter. He should have enough playable power and defensive versatility to merit a low-end platoon role. This is probably a slower burn player who is still a couple years away even though he's made it to Double-A."
Mason Montgomery,SIRP,TBR,2025,,45,Med,24.8,,,,,"Montgomery was moved to the bullpen in the latter half of 2024 and his stuff exploded. He was struggling in a piggyback role at Durham through July, and was running an ERA approaching 7.00 when his role changed. In short relief, Montgomery went from sitting 91-95 to sitting 96-98, sometimes for six outs at a time. He essentially scrapped his changeup in relief, and is working with that riding upper-90s fastball and an inconsistent slider in the 86-89 mph range. The fish-to-water nature of Montgomery's shift suggests the Rays should just leave him in the bullpen. In addition to plus velocity, Monty's fastball has vertical riding life. His slider's movement is unpredictable, but for the last month of the season when it was suddenly 88 mph or so, it played like a plus pitch. Whether it's in long relief or a late-inning role, Montgomery's new level of stuff has him poised to play a high-leverage relief role when camp breaks in 2025."
Dexters Peralta,SS,NYY,2030,,40+,High,17.7,45,40,50,60,"Peralta has a very exciting combination of tools and projection, and he has a shot to be an excellent defensive shortstop with meaningful switch-hitting power. He slashed a modest .219/.320/.325 in his DSL pro debut, which included a scary 29.4% K%, but Peralta was one of the youngest players in all of pro baseball and has great looking hitting hands that should become more precise as he gains strength and experience. Peralta's loudest present skill is his arm strength, which might be elite at maturity. He's lithe, agile, and athletic enough to remain at shortstop long-term. Right now, Peralta will hit some seeds into the gap, as well as some slasher-style doubles. He's built in such a way that he's very likely to add considerable power via strength training as his career progresses, enough that Peralta can strike out more than average and still be an impact player. 
There's definitely risk here because Peralta is very, very far from the Bronx, and if his contact rate doesn't improve in 2025 (when he will likely repeat the DSL), then this will have been too aggressive of a grade at this juncture. But visually, Peralta is a really exciting prospect with everyday player upside. Were he a high school draft prospect, he'd be in the late first/early second round mix based on his tools."
Zac Veen,RF,COL,2025,,40+,High,23.3,40,40,45,70,"Cracks in Veen's toolsy profile, which includes electrifying speed and plus raw power projection, began to show after he was promoted to Hartford in 2022. His 2023 was shortened and likely compromised by an injury to his wrist that necessitated season-ending surgery. He had something of a bounce-back 2024 as he hit .258/.346/.459 and reached Triple-A betwixt and between another couple of injuries, this time to his back and thumb. The Rockies put Veen on the 40-man roster after the season and it's plausible he debuts in 2025, though because there's an enormous stack of players with less roster flexibility ahead of him on the outfield depth chart, a 2026 debut is much more likely. This grade remains skeptical of Veen's future ability to hit and access his raw power, but appreciates how impactful his speed will be in a part-time outfield role. 
I'm excited by Veen for the same reasons anyone would be: He's a ferocious rotator capable of hitting some epic home runs, and he's built as if Maserati started making human beings. Veen has one of the more electric power/speed combos in the minors, but his levers and long, low-ball swing make it very difficult for him to be on time to the contact point, especially against fastballs, which has led to a good number of strikeouts and mediocre contact. Pitchers work him in on the hands, then get him to swing over the top of back-foot breaking balls once Veen starts to cheat on heaters in that spot. He's best able to create power against bad breaking balls and pitches located down-and-away from him, when he can get his arms fully extended. When he does, it's very beautiful and easy to see why so many folks (including your author) have been gaga for Veen at various points in his prospectdom. Still, as it's currently constituted, he presents a below-average contact and game power look.
Veen brings other meaningful stuff to the table. He plays with an elite motor, moves from base to base with just a few gigantic strides, and commits to the next base with abandon in borderline situations. There are more opportunities for speed to impact the big league game now, which helps elevate Veen into a more impactful FV tier. On defense, his speed allows him to turn would-be doubles into singles by chasing them down before they can trickle into the gap or corner, but he doesn't get good reads and looks uncomfortable at the catch point. Despite his wheels, the Rockies have basically never given Veen any kind of extended run in center field because his reads and routes aren't good. It makes Veen feel like a turbo charged fifth outfielder on a good team rather than a true fourth or platoon guy."
Connor Noland,SP,CHC,2026,,40,Low,25.7,,,,,"Noland had a busy freshman year at Arkansas. He played quarterback in four football games that fall, then finished the school year with a trip to the College World Series and SEC All-Freshman honors. He lost most of 2020 to the pandemic and much of 2021 to a forearm injury, returning in a bullpen capacity that year. He reclaimed a rotation spot in 2022, filling in for fellow Razorback Peyton Pallette, and made the most of his Friday starter role with a dominant senior season that earned him a ninth round selection by the Cubs. He has raced to Triple-A while efficiently mixing in six different pitches if you count his cutter, four-seamer and two-seamer as distinct offerings. Noland's stuff isn't sexy, but he mixes and commands it well, which is especially true of how he deploys his breaking stuff. He should debut as a spot starter and eventually take root in a backend starter role by virtue of his consistency."
Joe Elbis,SP,ARI,2025,,40,Med,22.5,,,,,"Elbis is a wispy Venezuelan righty who has been on the radar as a backend starter for a while. His strike-throwing regressed in 2023, then rebounded in 2024. He features a low-90s fastball/two-plane slider mix most of the time. The arm-side movement of his curveball gives him a weapon against lefties, and an improving changeup might give him a second. Elbis worked 135.1 innings in 2024 and pitched at Double-A for the last six weeks of the year. He is an up/down starter type with the physical characteristics for continued growth that might allow him to fill a stable fifth starter role down the road. He'll likely be in the mix for 2025 spot starts."
Nate Furman,2B,SFG,2026,,40,Low,23.7,60,60,30,60,"Furman is a pesky little second baseman who has been one of the prospect world's most difficult hitters to make whiff for the last several years. He had nearly twice as many walks as strikeouts as a draft-eligible sophomore with UNC Charlotte, then posted one of the lowest swinging strike rates in all of the minors at a microscopic 3.2% during his first year in Cleveland's system. Though he was shelved with a shoulder injury at the time, Furman was traded to San Francisco as part of the Alex Cobb deal at the 2024 deadline. 
His short stature allows Furman to wait forever before deciding to swing. He rarely chases and spoils a ton of tough pitches, but he lacks the power of a traditional everyday hitter. The ceiling on Furman's offense looks something like Adam Frazier's career, and similar to Frazier, Furman is not a very good second base defender. He's speedy and has good range, but poor hands and an arm that's well below average often force him to use all-out effort to make plays that others find routine. Furman's speed should allow him to play the outfield, too, but overall, he has below-average defensive versatility when compared to other utility type hitters. He has bottom-of-the-40-man projection as a ball-in-play specialist."
Brady Basso,SP,ATH,2025,,40,Low,27.5,,,,,"Two of the first three full seasons of Basso's pro career were totally wiped out by the pandemic and a 2021 Tommy John. He had a 2023 breakout at High-A Lansing, ended the season with a cup of coffee at Double-A, was added to the 40-man roster in the offseason, then made his big league debut in 2024. He threw 93 innings between Double- and Triple-A, struck out 27.5% of batters, walked 6.3%, and made his first four big league starts at the end of the year. 
Basso continues to work with a below-average fastball, but his feel for staying out of the heart of the plate is pretty good. He sits about 92 mph with downhill plane, and mixes in a cutter and curveball, with the latter being his best bat-misser. The sharpness of its break and vertical action generated a 38.5% swing-and-miss rate during his major league innings. The depth on Basso’s cutter tends to vary. Most feature short, quick action, but he'll occasionally flash slider-like depth on the offering, which consistently shows average teeth. Last year,  Eric noted that Basso would really benefit from adding a changeup, and that’s exactly what he did in 2024. At present, the pitch usually lacks notable movement, but his ability to maintain his fastball arm speed makes it a usable show-me type offering. While Basso doesn't have an incredibly high ceiling, he looks capable of holding down a back-of-the-rotation, innings-eater type role."
Joswa Lugo,SS,LAA,2030,,40,High,18.2,40,40,55,60,"Lugo's rare power/speed combination drove his amateur clout, and he signed for $2.3 million in January of 2024. He was not ranked as highly here at FanGraphs as his bonus might indicate because Lugo had hit tool question marks and was at risk of a move to a corner. His arm strength gives him a chance to develop into a viable shortstop defender, but his size is going to be a barrier over time. Lugo hit for power in his pro debut, but also K'd at a 23% clip, which is pretty high for a DSL hitter but completely expected based on Lugo's amateur report. He holds in this FV tier heading into his second pro season. This is a high-variance power-hitting prospect whose hit tool might cause the bottom to fall out of his profile eventually."
Nick Montgomery,C,ATL,2030,,40,High,19.4,40,40,50,40,"Montgomery is a big-framed, power-hitting catcher prospect who was coaxed away from Arizona State with a bonus just shy of a million bucks. He didn't play after the draft and is probably the most important extended spring scouting target in the org. 
Montgomery has a big league frame at a strapping 6-foot-4, and he has a very authoritative top hand through contact, which creates exciting pull power. We have next to no showcase performance data for Montgomery from which to derive any kind of accurate assessment of his hit tool; this guy is going from hitting varsity pitching to facing pro arms, so there's a high degree of volatility here, even more than is typically associated with prep catchers. 
Counterintuitively, the most advanced aspect of Montgomery's game right now might be his receiving. It will no doubt also be tested by pro-quality stuff, but for an athlete his size to be as flexible and skilled a low-pitch framer as Montgomery seems to be is impressive. In addition to the hit tool indicators, Montgomery's throwing is his other key developmental variable. He was popping 2.1 a lot of the time in high school. He just takes too long to let it go and his exchange needs to get faster. This is an exciting developmental prospect with some of the better upside in the Braves system."
Seth Johnson,SIRP,PHI,2025,,40,High,26.5,,,,,"Johnson didn't have great college numbers at Campbell in 2019, but his stuff was electric, and the athletic former middle infielder was new to the mound and thought to perhaps just be scratching the surface of his ability. The Rays selected him with the 40th overall pick, then watched Johnson's stuff take a leap as he posted a strikeout rate of nearly 30% in his 2021 full-season debut. He made it just a month into 2022 before he was shut down with an elbow injury, and was later traded from Tampa Bay to Baltimore at the 2022 deadline as part of the multi-team Trey Mancini swap. Johnson had Tommy John just a few days afterward. The Orioles were willing to use a 2023 40-man spot on a rehabbing Johnson, who returned to an affiliated mound barely a year after that. Now more than two years post-surgery, his control hasn't gotten much better. He also doesn't have a weapon to deal with lefties, as Johnson's best secondaries remain his usual curveball and cutter. Especially now that he's entering his last option year, Johnson is pretty likely to be a stock middle reliever."
Jake Miller,MIRP,DET,2026,,40,Med,23.8,,,,,"Miller barely pitched at Valpo, logging just 10.2 innings combined as a freshman and sophomore before he was deployed as a starter in 2022. He entered pro ball as a dev project with good mechanics and has developed a damn good changeup that wasn't present in college, growth that has happened with very few reps because Miller barely pitched during his first full pro season due to triceps and forearm strains. In 2024, he worked 87.1 inning, mostly in relief, and posted a 0.94 WHIP and 1.85 ERA while racing from Low- to Double-A throughout the year. He was a bit more Jekyll and Hyde in the Arizona Fall League after that, but he still struck out well over a batter per inning in 16.2 innings there. 
Miller's mid-80s changeup has nasty late sink and plays as a bat-misser against both lefties and righties. It's often around 85 mph, but he'll throw it hard enough to activate a flux capacitor at 88 mph. The rest of Miller's repertoire is closer to average but plays up a bit thanks to deception, as he shows hitters the ball very late and his arm slot creates rise/tail action on his heater. Miller's slider, which was his go-to secondary in college, is average on pure stuff and is reliant on his command. It has a sweeper-style look, with much more lateral action than vertical depth, and is the slowest of his three offerings at 80-83 mph. His repertoire is on the starter/reliever line at the moment, but Miller improved it while also setting a career-high innings mark in 2024. At the rate he's developing, he might look more comfortably like a big league starting pitcher 12 months from now. Even if he ends up continuing to work in long relief (which seems well within reason based on Miller's 2024 look), that's still a great outcome for an eighth rounder from a smaller program. Likely to begin 2025 at Erie, Miller is on track to be added to Detroit's 40-man after the season and debut in 2026."
Ian Seymour,MIRP,TBR,2025,,45,Med,26.3,,,,,"Seymour had a dominant 2021, then made just a few starts in 2022 before he was shut down with a flexor strain; he had Tommy John that June. He missed the bulk of 2023 recovering from surgery but returned in time to toss 42 frames and strike out just under 30% of the hitters he faced. He was dominant in 2024 and worked a career-high 145 innings.
Suddenly Seymour is not only back, but perhaps better than ever before. Violent deception and a plus changeup drive his ability to miss bats. He has an NC-17 delivery with a grotesque head whack, but it doesn't seem to inhibit his ability to throw strikes. His fastball sits an underwhelming 88-92 mph, but it holds its plane very well and, combined with the deception in his delivery, is playing like a plus pitch. His changeup has 10 ticks of separation from his fastball and he sells it like a seasoned used car salesman by maintaining his delivery's effort and arm speed. Seymour has two breaking balls, with his 80-84 mph slider the superior offering. It has two-plane shape and often shows considerable depth, and it's a really tough pitch for left-handed hitters to do much with. His curveball is a big, slow (69-74 mph) vertical breaker that is more of a strike-stealer than a pitch he’ll regularly rely on. He'll also mix in a short, mid-upper 80s cutter that he uses as an additional weapon to stay off right-handers' barrels. 
Seymour is almost 26 years old, so his dominance over Double-A hitters was to be expected, but given how fresh he is off TJ, the way he's sustained it start after quality start is very encouraging. We're still skeptical this kind of delivery can hold up under starter's innings, but Seymour is officially on his way to proving us wrong. We think he'll likely serve as a really good multi-inning reliever (and occasional spot starter) where he can maximize his best offerings in short bursts."
Connor Prielipp,SIRP,MIN,2025,,40+,High,24.2,,,,,"As a wild freshman at Alabama, Prielipp looked like he might be an eventual top-five pick because of the quality of his stuff, primarily an upper-90s fastball and a devastating slider. He dealt with a couple periods of injury culminating in a Tommy John surgery in late May of 2021 that kept him out for the entire 2022 college season. He threw a bullpen for scouts near the end of the college calendar and then threw again at the 2022 Combine, in both instances sitting 92-94 mph with a more consistently short arm action than he showed before he blew out. Prielipp's slider was arguably the best pitch in the entire 2022 draft, but he came with more relief risk than most of the other college pitchers projected to go in the first two rounds, and he ultimately went in the second. 
Prielipp did not pitch at an affiliate after signing with the Twins but was nails during 2023 spring training. Specifically, his slider was spinning in at its usual 3,000-ish rpm, but it had added a few ticks of velocity and suddenly resided in the upper-80s, which is rare for a pitch that spins that fast. Prielipp's changeup also looked better than it did in college. The shorter arm action helped him sell it better than he was able to at 'Bama, arguably giving Prielipp a greater chance to start than was thought before the draft. It took all of 6.2 innings for him to blow out again, and he had the internal brace style elbow procedure in July of 2023. When he returned in 2024, Prielipp was nails. His slider remains tighter than a snare drum, his fastball averaged 94-95 mph and his changeup performed like a plus pitch (but is too inconsistent to the eye to consider truly plus right now). The lone issue here is that Prielipp only worked 23.1 innings. If he can hold this velo across a lot more innings in 2025, then he could be considered a good fourth starter a year from now. There's also a scenario where Prielipp is fast tracked as a reliever and plays a late-inning role in 2025."
Ruben Castillo,CF,NYY,2031,,40+,High,17.2,40,40,50,60,"Castillo is a very exciting, projectable center field prospect who worked out both on the infield and in the outfield as an amateur. He's a cut, angular athlete built like a prototypical center fielder. Twitchy and fast, Castillo also has a plus outfield arm, and the way his body unwinds when he uncorks one is both beautiful and explosive. As a hitter, he has quick, fairly powerful hands, but his swing is really, really long. There's hit tool risk here because of Castillo's swing, but his up-the-middle fit and power projection give him considerable upside. He signed for a little shy of $1 million in January and is among the toolsier prospect to follow in this year's DSL."
Cole Carrigg,CF,COL,2027,,40+,Med,22.9,40,40,45,55,"Carrigg is a unique multi-positional prospect, a fair switch-hitter with some low ball pop from the left side of the plate and an all-world arm. He slashed .283/.359/.491 with 17 homers in his first full pro season, spent mostly at High-A Spokane. Both visual scouting and a data-oriented assessment of Carrigg as a hitter have him more average (contact) or a shade below (raw power). Both of Carrigg's swings are geared for pull and lift (he has a pretty classic low-ball stroke as a lefty), and he'll be able to get to relevant (if modest) power. 
The Rockies deployed Carrigg behind the plate a little bit right after he turned pro, but he spent most of 2024 in center field, with infrequent starts at shortstop. A long-striding runner, Carrigg has plus speed underway but takes a little while to get going. In a year and a half of pro ball, Carrigg has now played twice as many games in center field as he did throughout his three years of college. He was more comfortable out there late in 2024 than he was at the start and should be average there in time. Plus, he brings show-stopping arm strength to the table. The way Carrigg's body unfurls on a max-effort outfield chuck is incredible, though he isn't an accurate infield thrower at all, and it's a big enough issue that he might just be an outfielder. The peak outcome for Carrigg would be a dynamic, Willi Castro-esque utilityman, though he's trending more like a good part-time outfielder whose career might have a relevant second act on the mound."
Jonathon Long,1B,CHC,2026,,40,Med,23.2,40,40,55,40,"Long had a breakout 2024, his first full pro season, as he hit 17 bombs in 114 games and got better from a strikeout standpoint after he was promoted to Double-A in the second half. Long followed that up with an OPS north of 1.000 in the Arizona Fall League. More importantly, he got reps at third base in Arizona. The Cubs are searching for a position for Long, who played both corner infield spots in college and has tried left field in pro ball. He played third more times (10) during the six-week AFL span than he did all regular season (eight). Long is a very tightly-wound athlete who is much more comfortable at first base than those other positions. He lacks the mobility of an average third baseman; he's in same-aged Jake Burger territory in terms of his build and type of athleticism. 
Long is a ferocious in-the-box rotator with plus power. The length of his swing causes him to inside-out a lot of fastballs. He has the juice to do damage that way, but it's concerning how often he is late on mid-minors fastballs such that he's driving them to right field. There isn't a great sample to use as a guide here. Sometimes it's helpful to look at splits versus big league-quality fastball velocities to get a better feel for how a player's contact ability will trend as he climbs, but Long simply didn't face enough 93-plus mph fastballs on tape for that. As such, we're relying more heavily on the look here, and we're pessimistic Long will continue on a 16.7% K%, 10% swinging strike, 75% contact clip. This puts pressure on him to play at least one other position because the contact/power combo for a snug first base fit probably won't be there. He's a prospect in the J.D. Davis mold."
Yu-Min Lin,SP,ARI,2026,,40,Low,21.7,,,,,"Lin had an eventful and ultimately triumphant 2024. He suffered a broken jaw and concussion when he was hit by a foul ball at the end of April, which kept him out until June, but he still managed to make 21 starts, work just over 100 innings, and reach Triple-A Reno by the very end of the season. Lin then went to the Arizona Fall League to stay hot as he prepared to be one of Taiwan's starters in the Premier12 tournament. Taiwan made a surprise run to the event's championship game and Lin was handed the ball to face Samurai Japan, which hadn't lost in international competition since 2019. Lin worked four innings of one-hit ball as he and three other Taiwanese pitchers combined for a four-hit shutout and defeat of Japan. It was perhaps the biggest baseball game in Taiwanese history. 
Lin's moxy, confidence (this guy was staring down and jawing with NPB stars during that Premier12 title game) and athleticism are all quite special, but his stuff and command are not. While his delivery has an electricity to it, his arm action is quite long and tough for him to repeat. Very successful starters who sit 88-92 like Lin does tend to have razor sharp command, and while Lin isn't at risk of moving to the bullpen because of strike-throwing issues or anything like that, he isn't exactly a surgeon. Lin's best secondary pitch is his big-breaking 76-79 mph slurve, which is a great strike-stealing pitch for him but not something he can locate for chase. An uphill 85-88 mph cutter and low-80s changeup both tend to sail on Lin, though his four-pitch mix gives him several distinct shapes and speeds with which to attack hitters. More fun than functional at the moment, Lin is still two seasons away from Rule 5 Draft exposure, so he'll operate as upper-level depth without occupying a 40-man roster spot for a while. He should eventually be a consistently rostered fifth starter."
Wade Meckler,CF,SFG,2025,,40,Low,24.9,55,60,35,50,"Meckler is an undersized, contact-oriented extra outfielder whose nine home runs in 2024 were easily a career high. He still lacks anything resembling sufficient power for a corner outfielder, though Meckler has definitely gotten stronger and closed that gap a bit. His carrying tool is still his bat-to-ball ability. Meckler is good at getting on top of high pitches and spraying line drive contact to the opposite field. The Giants keep deploying Meckler in center, where he's below average but passable enough to play a fifth outfield role on a big league roster."
Will Johnston,SP,ATH,2027,,40,Med,24.3,,,,,"Johnston moved from Texas A&M's bullpen into their rotation in the middle of his draft year and the A's have continued to stretch him out in pro ball. So far, it's working. Johnston pitched at three levels in 2024, covering 99.2 innings and striking out 33% of the batters he faced. Johnston also kept his walk rate just under 10% on the year, which is an encouraging sign after he posted some lofty free pass totals during his amateur career. Johnston hides the ball forever and has a due north arm slot that imparts ride on his fastball. He has a pretty generic vertical breaking ball that plays off of that; it has good finish and depth when it's buried, but not enough bite to miss bats in the zone. The quality of Johnston’s splitter can still really vary; his best ones show tumbling action with late depth, while others are still prone to floating on him and have little movement at all. If the split can progress to being a consistently average offering, Johnston has a back-of-the-rotation future ahead of him. If not, he has a favorable multi-inning relief profile."
Gabriel Davalillo,C,LAA,2031,,40,High,17.4,30,30,50,30,"Davalillo is a power-over-hit catcher with a plus arm. He has an incredibly strong lower body. Built like a member of a celebrity's security detail, Davalillo generates impressive power during BP with a flick of his wrist. He doesn't track pitches well in games; his head flies all over the place and causes lots of swing and miss. His receiving and ball-blocking haven't been tested by pro stuff yet, but Davalillo is really twitchy and has the size of a prototypical primary catcher. Hit tool question marks keep Davalillo out of a higher upside FV tier, but he has big variance in both directions."
Luke Sinnard,SP,ATL,2027,,40,High,22.4,,,,,"Sinnard, who only started playing baseball during his senior year of high school, began his college career at Western Kentucky, then had a sophomore breakout at Indiana when he set the school's single-season strikeout record with 114 ponchados in 86.1 innings. He blew out in a postseason start at the end of 2023, but was back in time to throw at the 2024 Draft Combine and in scouted pre-draft bullpens. 
Sinnard's fastball was 93-94 at the Combine with plus-plus induced vertical break (unadjusted for release height). His pre-TJ, in-game delivery had much more effort and violence than the Combine version. He utilizes a vertical attack with the fastball and then bends multiple breaking balls off of that. It's very tough to predict which speed and shape of breaking ball is coming — it could be an upper-70s curve, or a mid-80s slider and cutter. Sinnard showed skilled cutter location at the top/glove-side part of the zone before he blew out. Yet another injured or surface-scratching type of prospect drafted by the Braves, if Sinnard's mechanical violence can be quelled, he has the repertoire of a good backend starter, and there's a chance he's got more in the tank as a guy who has only been pitching in truly competitive settings for a short period of time."
Petey Halpin,CF,CLE,2025,,40,Low,22.8,55,60,40,60,"Halpin has tracked like a future fifth outfielder for practically his entire pro career based largely on his speed and defense. Even though he has drastically altered his swing since entering pro ball (his stance has really opened up), his offensive profile is very similar to his amateur scouting report. Halpin's swing is geared for low-ball contact and he tends to inside-out the baseball to left field. His strikeout rates have crept up as he's climbed through the minors, and he's likely to mature into below-average offensive tools, but Halpin's secondary skills will give him roster utility as a fifth outfielder."
Christian McGowan,SIRP,PHI,2025,,40,Med,25.1,,,,,"McGowan returned from TJ in the middle of 2023 with a revamped delivery and was able to sustain 94-96 mph sinkers across 42.2 innings between the regular season and the Arizona Fall League. In 2024, multiple IL stints limited him to 56 innings combined between the regular season and the AFL. Spotty strike-throwing and injuries funnel McGowan's projection toward the bullpen. He sat 95-96 mph and was up to 97 in the Fall League last year, and worked with two good breaking balls, a low-90s cutter and an 84-87 mph sweeper. McGowan's changeup lags behind those pitches. He should be a solid middle reliever."
Ethan Schiefelbein,SP,DET,2028,,40,Low,19,,,,,"Schiefelbein starred at Corona High School in California, a program that will produce a couple of the top draft picks in the 2025 class. Ethan is more of a low-variance backend starter prospect who will show you lots of 88-92 (albeit with above-average carry even though it's a two-seamer) and bump 95. Schiefelbein's mid-70s knuckle curveball has above-average depth and bite. Its shape pairs nicely with his fastball, and the quality of his curve allows for projection on a second breaking ball. He also commands an upper-70s circle changeup that lacks bat-missing movement right now, but should improve with reps because of Schiefelbein's compact arm stroke and general feel to pitch. He has a lower center of gravity, his build is atypical compared to most high school pitching prospects, and we aren't sure how projectable he is, but also he has precocious touch-and-feel command, and an effortless and fluid delivery. Similar to Cleveland lefty Michael Kennedy, Schiefelbein has a pretty high floor for a high school draftee thanks to the quality of his secondary stuff and his command. If he can somehow throw harder (again, given his build, that's not a slam dunk), the rest of his skill set is in place for a sizable breakout."
Carlos Lagrange,SIRP,NYY,2028,,40+,High,21.8,,,,,"Perhaps the pitcher in the Yankees system with the greatest potential variance, Lagrange has a mustang of a right arm that generates upper-90s velocity while not having been tamed in the slightest. Lower back inflammation limited him to 29.2 innings combined between the 2024 regular season and Arizona Fall League, with Lagrange walking 35 batters during that span. 
A relatively soft-bodied 6-foot-7, Lagrange has incredible arm speed, but the rest of his delivery is either inconsistent or relatively unathletic. He is highly unlikely to develop control sufficient to start, and he might be too wild to hold down a higher-leverage relief role, but he certainly has the stuff for the latter. In three-inning bursts, he shows you 96-98 mph fastballs and touches above; they have downhill plane and ineffective movement, but they're still hard enough to be nasty. Lagrange's breaking stuff has been tweaked a time or two over the last couple of years. During the 2024 season, he went from throwing a curveball to more of a hard, upper-80s cutter/slider, and then seemingly went back to a 77-84 mph curveball in the AFL; readers should consider this pitch type to be in flux for now. Both flash plus, but their movement and locations are inconsistent, and that's true for Lagrange's tertiary 90-mph changeup as well. 
It's worth it for the Yankees to develop Lagrange as a starter for at least the next two years to give him as many reps as possible in the search for some modicum of consistency. Holding out for as long as possible was the correct strategy to take with Luis Gil, and Lagrange looks similar to how Gil did at the same stage of his career. His realistic outcomes span from a wild, fringe reliever to a late-inning weapon."
Ty Johnson,SP,TBR,2026,,40+,Med,23.5,,,,,"Johnson looks more physical now than he did at Ball State, where he struggled with walks as a junior and only worked 53.2 innings. The Cubs shortened the 6-foot-6 righty's arm action, and he was dominant at their A-ball affiliates before he was traded to Tampa Bay as part of the Isaac Paredes swap. When his first pro season was done, Johnson had a 2.79 ERA and 1.00 WHIP in a piggyback role in 84 combined innings across both A-ball levels, and had struck out 120 men. His velocity climbed in the middle of the season and, after sitting 92 early, he was more 94-95 as the deadline approached, a range he maintained for the rest of the year. 
The shorter arm action also helped Johnson to have more consistent feel for release, and he's throwing plenty of strikes with his funky tailing fastball, which has bat-missing ability thanks to its uphill angle. His breaking ball, usually in the 82-85 mph range, is comfortably plus, with tight, late two-plane movement. If Johnson can improve his changeup, which is currently below average, then he'll have a starter's coffer of pitches. His arm circle is so comically short and tight that it may not be in the cards for him to do that, at least in a traditional sense. Johnson has a middle relief floor with the fastball/breaking ball combo he's currently wielding, and also has some late-bloomer characteristics (his size, small school background, a fairly new delivery) that indicate he might be able to keep improving."
Michael Kennedy,SP,CLE,2027,,40+,Low,20.3,,,,,"Kennedy has advanced command of two good off-speed pitches and well below average fastball velocity, sitting 88-91. He was a 2022 over slot fourth rounder who signed for $1 million rather than go to LSU, and in 2024 he pitched his way to High-A. A short-levered 6-foot-1, Kennedy’s physical traits combine with his low-to-the-ground delivery help his fastball punch above its weight. The line it takes to the plate is flat, and tough for hitters to get on top of. The vertical snap and 11-to-5 movement of Kennedy’s 77-83 mph breaking ball plays nicely off of his fastball, and Kennedy commands both and likes to alter his leg kick to mess with hitters’ timing. Kennedy’s feel for locating his 82-84 mph changeup improved in 2024 and that pitch generated above-average chase and miss. This is a high-floored backend starter prospect tracking for a 2027 debut. Most 20-year-old pitchers have a fair bit of physical projection left, Kennedy less so based on his frame but arguably more based on his athleticism. Cleveland has been able to coax more arm strength guys who weren’t obviously projectable, and if they can do the same with Kennedy (while he retains his great command) then he’ll break out and look more like a mid-rotation candidate."
Kelvin Hidalgo,SS,COL,2029,,40+,High,20.1,30,30,50,50,"Hidalgo is a toolsy shortstop prospect with precocious power and potentially great defense. He had a monster 2023 season, his second in the DSL, where he slugged .574 and hit 12 homers, good for second in the league. His production was down the following year in Arizona — .288/.347/.365 — but Hidalgo was still one of just two hitters Colorado promoted from the complex to Fresno toward the end of the year (Robert Calaz was the other). 
Hidalgo has all the physical talent needed for shortstop (especially the arm), but he's currently unpolished and mistake-prone. He's also big enough that it's possible he'll outgrow the position, but with that size comes exciting power projection. Hidalgo already has roughly average big league power and he'll likely grow into more. He isn't an especially skilled hitter — Hidalgo's swing is long and imprecise, and isn't anywhere near optimized to take advantage of his power. This is a risky prospect in a number of ways, but good shortstops with plus power are rare. Jose Barrero and Gabriel Arias represent outcomes with way too many strikeouts, while the Danny Espinosa and Tim Beckham window of production is more of Hidalgo's median outcome."
Hunter Dobbins,SP,BOS,2026,,40+,Low,25.6,,,,,"Dobbins was hidden as an underclassman at Texas Tech because he was a reliever as a freshman, his sophomore year was wiped out due to COVID, and he blew out and needed TJ as a junior. Aside from his dwindling groundball rates, Dobbins coasted through Double-A and ended his 2024 season at Triple-A Worcester.  His innings count has climbed (he threw 120 innings in 2024) to the point where he could feasibly handle a big league starter's workload as soon as next season. 
Dobbins doesn't have an exciting athletic look or delivery, but he still throws hard, up to 98. His mix of breaking balls (cutters up to 93 mph, sliders in the 81-84 mph range, upper-70s curveballs) is pretty average from a pure stuff standpoint, except for the curveball, which is his repertoire's bat-misser. Late in the season, Dobbins' splinker became more identifiable when he pitched in parks with publicly-available TrackMan data. He uses it against hitters on both sides of the plate, and it has utility as a bat-misser (when located well) and groundball getter. The emergence of that pitch is the key to Dobbins getting a grade bump here; he has platoon-neutralizing weapons now. Dobbins is on the starter/reliever line, but even if his command remains worse than average, he should be an impactful long reliever."
Cole Mathis,1B,CHC,2027,,40,Low,21.7,55,55,45,45,"Mathis crushed on Cape Cod in 2023 and posted a .335/.472/.650 line with more walks (46) than strikeouts (32) at the College of Charleston in 2024, which resulted in the Cubs taking him with the 54th overall pick and inking a slot deal ($1.68 million). While a quick glance at Mathis suggests he has some feel for the strike zone, there’s also a high degree of passivity in his approach. This past spring, Mathis only swung at 36% of the pitches he saw, and possibly more notable is the fact that he only swung at 58% of pitches in the heart of the zone (the college average is 73%). Nearly all of his home run power in games comes to the pull side, but he’s strong enough to drive doubles pop to all fields, and he can manipulate the bat to produce consistent contact when he does swing. Mathis will reside on the low end of the defensive spectrum, where he profiles to be an above-average defender at first base. Because there isn't an outlier trait in his offensive profile and he's bound for first base long-term, Mathis is a high floor/low ceiling depth type, a corner contact bat who needs to get in the weight room to produce the power we associate with his position."
Yassel Soler,3B,ARI,2028,,40,High,19.2,50,60,50,40,"Soler is a bat control wizard who hasn't met a pitch he didn't think he could hit, and a lot of the time he's right. He posted nutty 2023 TrackMan data in the DSL (92% in-zone, 5% swinging strike), and while those numbers came back to Earth in 2024 (86% and 10%, respectively) when Soler came to the U.S. for complex ball, he was still arguably the most dangerous hitter on that roster. In his 239 plate appearances on the complex in 2024, Soler posted an .824 OPS while striking out 17.2% of the time. He walked just under 7% of the time. His overall chase rate on the season came in at just under 30%, but his two-strike chase rate was a scary 49%, and he’s especially prone to expanding against spin. 
Soler attacks pitches all over the zone (and outside of it) and sprays hard contact everywhere. His swing is very handsy — there isn't a lot of athletic stuff happening with the rest of his body — and at times has a downward path, but his hands are so quick and his bat speed is so dynamic that, so far, it's working for Soler. We also thought Soler made progress as an athlete and defender in 2024. He's leaner and stronger now than he was during his pro debut and this has improved his mobility on defense, though he's still at risk of moving off of third base eventually. 
There are a lot of similarities to Miguel Andujar and Ty France in Soler's game. He's an exciting young hitter with flaws that tend to undermine the profile of below-average corner defenders like him, especially if they have to move to 1B/LF the way Andujar and France did. There are scouts who think that Soler will hit enough for none of this to matter and that he'll have the hit/power combination of an everyday corner infielder regardless of his position. We're a bit more apprehensive."
Charlie Szykowny,3B,SFG,2027,,40,Med,24.7,50,55,45,40,"Szykowny had a great first full season in pro ball, as he hit .295/.362/.451 split between Low- and High-A. There's definitely some age-related adjustment to be made to his performance, but he's a pretty well-rounded hitter with overt pro baseball size. Though he's a broad-shouldered and physical 6-foot-4, Szykowny's carrying tool is his bat-to-ball ability. He moved the barrel all over the zone in 2024 and had no obvious in-zone hole (88% z-contact rate), though he hasn't yet been tested by upper-level velocity, which might present a problem given his lever length. Until then, Szykowny has a fairly well-rounded offensive skill set that generates all-fields doubles pop. Though he has a big max-effort arm, he isn't nearly as mobile as the typical big league third baseman; he's also seen time at first. He looks like a 300 PA corner infield utility guy."
Cole Miller,SP,ATH,2028,,40,High,19.9,,,,,"Miller signed an over-slot $1 million deal as the A's 2023 fourth rounder rather than go to UCLA. He blew out and had Tommy John sometime during 2024 spring training. He's a projectable 6-foot-6 righty who flashed three viable pitches as a healthy high schooler. Mostly 90-93 mph without a ton of movement, Miller's size and ease of delivery portend more velocity, but his fastball might always play down a little. He shows inconsistent slider finish, but his best ones are 55s in the 82-84 mph range with traditional slider shape. His changeup has better long-term projection even though it's not used as often right now. Miller really sells the changeup with his arm speed, and creates tumble and tail on the pitch. It's also inconsistent due to a lack of use, but it has big ceiling down the road as Miller's touch and feel develops. This is a rock-solid starting pitching prospect, probably one with more of a medium ceiling due to his fastball's traits."
Garrett McDaniels,SIRP,LAA,2025,,40,Med,25.3,,,,,"A 2022 undrafted free agent out of Division II Mount Olive, McDaniels is a sinewy vertical slot southpaw who had a breakout 2024 after only pitching 19 total innings combined between the 2022 post-draft period and the 2023 season due to recovery from Tommy John. In 2024, his first relatively healthy pro season, McDaniels began the year in a piggyback role and worked as many as five innings at a time. When he returned from an IL stint (elbow tendinitis) in June, he was shifted into a relief role and immediately promoted to High-A Great Lakes. For the rest of the year, McDaniels worked an inning or two at a time and thrived. Across 25.1 innings at Great Lakes, he struck out 34 hitters and walked just five, posting a 0.95 WHIP and 2.49 ERA; he was promoted to Double-A at the very end of the season. McDaniels works downhill with a 93-ish mph sinker, and he added a second breaking pitch in 2024, a mid-80s slider with plus depth that quickly became his best pitch. He also has a slower curveball with similarly shaped movement. McDaniels is essentially trying to make the leap from High-A to the big leagues, which is tough, but from a stuff standpoint, he’s a fairly standard lefty middle reliever who fits the bill of a typical Rule 5 pick."
Carter Holton,SP,ATL,2026,,40,Med,22.6,,,,,"Holton was a three-year starter at Vanderbilt who had a dominant freshman year and then posted two average seasons thereafter, including a sophomore injury and a late-junior year fade and shutdown. He made one start after the 2024 draft, during which he sat his usual 92-94 mph across 55 pitches but appeared to have scrapped his curveball in favor of heavier slider usage; that slide piece came in two ticks harder than his tertiary college version. It's something to watch in 2025. 
Holton is an undersized but bouncy athlete who will hum in the mid-90s when he's right. He has a short, vertical arm stroke and hides the ball awhile, and his fastball has a relatively flat approach angle even though he has a higher-than-average release. His slider and changeup both generated plus rates of swing-and-miss at Vandy, while looking a little closer to big league average in terms of pure stuff, but now the slider is harder and nastier. The mid-70s curveball gave Holton a distinct four-pitch mix and seemed like good fit with his fastball shape, so let's see if it's been scrapped entirely or simply taken a back seat. 
The Braves paid Holton like a backend starter prospect. My pre-draft eval was a shade worse than that due to Holton's lack of size and projectability, as well as his mechanical violence and rocky last couple of seasons, but the new slider is enough of a difference-maker to upgrade his FV grade to be on par with where he was drafted. There's definitely more risk here than I would usually associate with a guy who was a three-year SEC starter, but lefties with sliders like this tend to have a big league relief floor."
Andrew Baker,SIRP,PHI,2025,,40,High,25,,,,,"Baker's raw stuff is incredibly nasty, but he's been so wild throughout his career that he was passed over in the 2024 Rule 5 Draft despite sitting 97 and bending in lots of plus-plus sliders during the season. Baker struck out a little more than 32% of opposing hitters in 2024 and spent most of the year at Reading. His incredible 83-86 mph slider generated a nearly elite 50% miss rate, but it's often nowhere near the zone and isn't chased very often. Baker only threw his fastball for strikes 59% of the time last year (65% is average) and is probably always going to be walk prone, but the quality of his stuff should enable him to play a low-leverage bullpen role."
Ty Madden,SP,DET,2025,,40,Low,25.1,,,,,"Madden is a six-pitch righty with a plus slider. In 2024, he carried a bloated ERA at Triple-A before he was moved to the bullpen upon his promotion to Detroit at the end of August. Madden's fastball is vulnerable to big damage, and if he continues to start, he should probably lean on his other stuff more heavily. He was doing a version of that in his six big league outings, which saw Madden mix in his slider, cutter, and changeup fairly evenly. All of them generated plus miss rates throughout 2024, but as Madden's delivery has included more and more effort, his ability to throw strikes with those secondaries (especially his changeup) has backed up and is now comfortably below-average. Madden's durability has been a positive aspect of his prospectdom, and he has worked about 120 innings each of the last three seasons, but he'll begin 2025 on the shelf with a strained rotator cuff. Upon his return, his immediate role will probably be dictated more by Detroit's needs than by his skills — the Tigers' pitching depth coupled with his injury will probably force him into a spot starter role at Toledo, or maybe even into the bullpen — but in a vacuum, he looks like a backend starter or swingman. "
Ryan Bergert,SIRP,SDP,2025,,40,Med,25.1,,,,,"Berget throws a ton of strikes with a 91-94 mph fastball and manipulates the shape and speed of a couple different breaking balls — mostly a slider (his best pitch) and cutter — and he's done that across about 100 innings for each of the last three years. He lacks plus stuff, but his feel for slider location is consistent enough that it might play like a plus pitch. Likely to play a spot starter role during his option years, Bergert profiles as a swingman long-term."
Adrian Santana,SS,TBR,2028,,40+,High,19.7,45,50,45,60,"Santana signed for just over $2 million, nearly $700,000 below the slot value as the 31st overall pick, and slashed .240/.300/.305 at Low-A in 2024, his first full pro season. Santana remains a high-variance dev project with exciting athleticism and hitting hands, but concerning breaking ball recognition and chase. He's still quite young and frail, but Santana makes up for some of what he lacks in physicality with plus athleticism. It's what helps him swing pretty hard from both sides of the plate, especially the left side, despite his size. His swing is long to enter the hitting zone, but his short levers help keep him from getting beat entirely, and this allows him to spray fastballs to the opposite field. Santana is surprisingly dangerous against pitches on the inner third, where his bat path is geared for power. He can button a fastball but struggles to recognize spin, and he goes fishing for breaking balls below the zone quite often. Unless he matures in this area, it's going to be important for him to fill out and develop meaningful power to support a low-OBP profile. 
Santana is a rangy and acrobatic defender whose arm strength is a fit at shortstop, though he needs to stay on top of the ball more consistently on his deeper throws. There's uncommon offensive upside for a shortstop here, but Santana's chase adds a significant risk element to his profile, rounding his FV down a shade below what his tools would usually dictate."
Ashly Andujar,SS,COL,2030,,40+,High,17.7,55,55,45,60,"Andujar signed with Colorado for $1.7 million in January of last year and was one of the youngest players in the class. He won't be 18 until the end of July, when he'll likely repeat the DSL. Amateur Andujar was billed as a speedy, contact-oriented infielder who should be a long-term shortstop fit, and that remains true. He only K'd 13.5% of the time last year and slashed .291/.376/.352. He is still very skinny and frail looking, but at just 17, that's fine. The foundation of a good baseball player is here, now Andujar needs to layer on strength. It might take a few years yet, but once he does that, he should break out."
Brody McCullough,SP,CHC,2026,,40,Med,24.7,,,,,"McCullough carved at Division-II Wingate University, then boosted his pre-draft visibility with a stint on Cape Cod. He had a very successful first full season in pro ball split between Low- and High-A, as he struck out 108 in 86.1 innings across 21 starts. He began 2024 on the IL recovering from a 2023 knee surgery, finished his rehab in Arizona, was quickly moved up to Double-A and then was put on the IL again with a shoulder strain and stayed there for the rest of the year. He played in just four games and made just three starts. 
When healthy, McCullough has the look of a potential no.4/5 starter. He has a riding 91-94 mph fastball that plays better than its pure velocity, as well as a low-80s bullet-style slider that he commands to the locations in which they're most effective. His changeup flashed bat-missing action in 2023, though this was less true in his healthy 2024 window. McCullough stood a chance to climb into the 45 FV tier by the end of 2024; instead, we're all waiting to see if he returns healthy in 2025."
Dylan Ray,SP,ARI,2026,,40,Med,23.9,,,,,"Ray only threw 31.1 innings (all in relief) in college because of a Tommy John surgery, and entered the D-backs system as a tip-of-the-iceberg sort set to be developed as a starter. He reached Double-A in 2023, his first full pro season, and ended up working 113.1 innings, which was more than double his 2022 output across Alabama, the Cape, and pro ball combined. Then Ray began 2024 on the 60-day IL with forearm tightness and was out until early June. He returned in time to make 17 regular season starts, with five more in the Fall League. 
The inconsistency of Ray's secondary stuff, both in quality and execution, was an issue for him in 2024, but he has four viable pitches, which is remarkable considering he had barely pitched in actual games until 2023. Ray's low-90s fastball has enough rise/run action to miss bats when it's located to the top corners of the zone. His mid-80s slider has late two-plane bite, his mid-70s curveball has plus depth at its best, and Ray's changeup shows enough action to miss bats. Ray is pretty loose in the strike zone with all of these offerings, which are all roughly average and not nasty enough to be effective if they're located poorly. Here, we're still bullish that Ray will improve as a strike thrower via reps, enough to be a solid backend starter. If he can stay healthy in 2025, he'll be tracking for a 2026 debut."
Jack Choate,MIRP,SFG,2026,,40,Low,23.9,,,,,"Choate is a funky low-slot lefty starter with a good changeup. He threw 111.2 innings combined between High- and Double-A in 2024, posting a 26.5% K%, 7.7% BB%, and 3.52 FIP. His command waned late in the year as Choate blew through his previous career-high mark for innings (which was only 68 frames); he had a 5% walk rate before the All-Star break versus 11% after. The key for Choate in this, his 40-man platform year, will be to show consistently good control all season. 
The large-framed southpaw has a mix of starter and reliever traits. His delivery looks effortless but features a low slot and cross-body stride typical of a lefty specialist reliever. Choate's best pitch is his changeup, which he pronates over the top of to create late, bat-missing sink. It gives him a platoon-neutralizing weapon, which is necessary for a guy whose fastball sits 88 mph from a low slot. He can dump in his slow, 74-mph slider against lefties and succeed because of his arm slot, but Choate will probably be vulnerable to big damage against righties, even with that changeup. It might mean that he's a better fit as a long reliever than a true starter, and that's the role he's projected in here."
Ryan Lasko,CF,ATH,2026,,40,High,22.8,30,40,40,60,"Lasko is a physical, plus-running outfielder from Rutgers who hit .330/.428/.582 with more walks than strikeouts as a junior. His combination of power, speed, and defense made him the second pick in the 2023. The leap from the Big Ten to pro pitching has so far been too much for Lasko, who is having a very difficult time making contact in pro ball. We still see above-average bat speed and power in the way Lasko swings, but he only hit six home runs in 569 plate appearances between Stockton and Lansing in 2024, while slashing .232/.353/.328 on the season. His bat path is conducive to handling pitches down in the zone but is vulnerable in other areas, and he posted a 67% contact rate in 2024. 
Lasko’s defensive chops in center field establish a higher floor for him than for most players who produce as little offense as he has. He goes after balls with controlled aggression, his plus foot speed allows him to cover up occasionally inefficient routes, and he's confident and athletic at the catch point, including around the wall. Lasko’s offensive profile doesn't provide much reason for optimism, but his defensive ability could give him solid value as a defense-first bench type."
Mitch Farris,SP,LAA,2027,,40,Med,24.1,,,,,"A 2023 Day Three pitck out of Division II Wingate, Farris (who came to LA in exchange for depth starter Davis Daniel) had a successful full-season debut in 2024, carrying a sub-3.00 ERA through 24 outings at Low- and High-A. He struck out 30% of opponents on the season even though his fastball velocity would barely be enough to make a flux capacitor hurdle you through time. Automatic pitch tagging systems think a lot of Farris' fastballs are changeups because he only sits about 88, but his vertical arm stroke and the riding life he creates on the pitch helps it miss bats above the strike zone. Two effective secondary pitches (a screwball-style changeup from a high slot and a low-spin breaking ball reliant on Farris' command), as well as Farris' ability to locate his fastball where it can be kept out of trouble, allow him to suceed despite what is basically 20-grade big league velocity. This abilitity will be stress-tested by upper-level hitters at some point, but for now, Farris looks like a stable backend starter or future swingman."
J.C. Escarra,C,NYY,2025,,40,Low,29.9,50,50,30,30,"Escarra has taken a scenic route through pro ball but enters 2025 as the odds-on favorite to break camp as Austin Wells' backup thanks to his defensive chops. He was drafted out of high school by the Mets but decided to go to school at FIU, where he played for four years (his junior year was cut short by a shoulder injury that required surgery) as a catcher and first baseman. Escarra was drafted by Baltimore and spent a half decade in their system before the O's released him just before the 2022 season. For the next two years, Escarra played pro ball in multiple domestic Independent leagues, the Mexican League, and the Puerto Rican Winter League. The Yankees signed him to a minor league deal in January of 2024, and Escarra split last season between Somerset and Scranton before going to LIDOM to fill out another square on his Winter League bingo card. 
It was during this time that Escarra began to incorporate third base and the outfield into his defensive mix, though he is easily best behind the plate. Other Yankees might want to avoid playing cards in the clubhouse with Escarra if the sleight of hand he wields around the edge of the strike zone extends to other activities. He's an awesome receiver and strike-stealer with an above-average arm, though Escarra isn't great at backhanding pitches in the dirt. Offensively, it's hard to contextualize Escarra's 2024 stats — .261/.355/.434 — because of his age. If there's an impressive, age-independent aspect of Escarra's performance, it's that he slayed 94-plus mph fastballs last year, and he's often on time to pull them. By virtue of his defense and ability to put the ball in play, he looks like a good backup."
Davis Polo,SP,ATL,2027,,40,Med,20.4,,,,,"Polo is an advanced strike-thrower and slider purveyor whose 2024 FIP was nearly two full runs better than his 5.16 ERA. Polo's tight gyro slider resides in the mid-80s and bites really, really late. His ability to dot it on the glove-side corner of the plate helps it play like a plus offering, and it might be better than that at peak if Polo can throw it (and the rest of his repertoire) harder as he enters his mid-20s. It's going to be important for him to throw a little bit harder because his fastball is currently below average and vulnerable to loud contact at around 92 mph. Polo's gorgeous arm action and feel for locating his changeup suggest that pitch should at least give him something to keep hitters off his heater in the event that he only ever has below-average velocity, which is a distinct possibility given his lack of size. The other potential saving grace for Polo will be his command, which is special for a pitcher his age and should help keep his fastball out of trouble. Polo's season ended with a strained rotator cuff, but he is otherwise a high-floored backend starter prospect with terrific command."
Josh Hartle,SP,CLE,2026,,40,Med,22,,,,,"Josh Hartle had exciting physical projection for his entire lifetime as a prospect but hasn’t yet delivered on it. He’s a 6-foot-5 lefty who had a ton of profile in high school and seemed like he might be the beneficiary of Wake Forest’s pitching dev program and potentially go in the first round of the 2024 draft. It looked like Hartle was making the leap as a sophomore, even without increased velocity, but his performance backed up during his junior year. Because of Wake’s reputation as a pitching factory, there’s concern that if there were better stuff here, they’d have unlocked it. All the elements that made Hartle an exciting high school prospect are still here (broad-shouldered 6-foot-5 frame, very repeatable delivery, starter-quality repertoire depth and command), but his fastball averaged 90 mph during the 2024 college season, Hartle gave up a lot of hits, and went in the third round. He features a five-pitch mix and mostly lives in the bottom of the zone. His sweeping breaking ball and changeup (both low-to-mid-80s) generated roughly average miss in 2024, while his fastball and cutter were way, way below average in that regard. This is grounder-getting (60% GB%) fifth starter stuff."
Wen-Hui Pan,SIRP,PHI,2027,,40,High,22.5,,,,,"Signed for $350,000 in January of 2023, Pan became the talk of that year's minor league spring camp because he arrived throwing very hard. Pan sat 92-94 mph during amateur international competition, but during his first spring with the Phils was sitting 96-98 while topping out at 99 mph. He quickly moved to the bullpen and held the velo bump through 2024, where he missed time early in the year with a broken pinkie finger before ascending to the closer role at Jersey Shore by the end of the season. Unfortunately, Pan needed Tommy John in November, putting him on pace to pitch in this year's Arizona Fall League like Andrew Painter did in 2024. 
Pan looks like a potential higher-leverage reliever when he's really humming. In addition to the premium velocity, he has a firm slider that averages about 85 mph and he'll flash a plus-plus splitter. Though his slider is more consistent, Pan's best splitters are easily his nastiest pitches. An invisible parachute pops out the back of his splits and opposing hitters flail at them helplessly. Pan should be back in 2026, his 40-man platform year, and be pushed to the upper-minors pretty aggressively to put him in position to prove he deserves a roster spot."
Yosber Sanchez,SIRP,DET,2026,,40,High,23.9,,,,,"Sanchez was released by Texas in the fall of 2022 and in two years with the Tigers org, he has gone from the DSL to High-A, where he finished the 2024 season. Across all of last season, Sanchez worked 61 innings in 40 appearances and posted a 31.5% K% and 11.5% BB%. He was not only able to maintain mid-to-upper-90s velocity across twice the number of innings he threw in 2023, but Sanchez's velo was up, and he continued pitching during the winter in Venezuela. The tailing shape of his fastball causes it to play down a bit, but Sanchez's mid-80s slider is often plus and missed bats much more consistently than his fastball did in 2024. Eighteen months ago, Sanchez was just an arm strength sleeper in the DSL. Now he looks more like a lock to be a middle reliever even though his fastball is likely to play down a bit."
Jhostynxon Garcia,RF,BOS,2026,,45+,High,22.3,35,40,60,50,"Despite posting red flag A-ball strikeout rates, Garcia made the bottom of the 2023 Red Sox prospect list because of his physicality and power. He's listed at just 163 pounds on his official minor league player page, but he's about 60 pounds heavier than that. He has thunderous power to the opposite field and his swing's finish is incredibly ferocious. This is a physically dense young man who has a shocking amount of fluidity in his hips and shoulders for someone so strong. Garcia's all-fields power was really only evident during in-person looks in prior years, but he finally produced on paper in 2024, posting 14 first-half home runs, more than he had in his first three seasons combined. He ended the season with 52 extra-base hits and a month of surprisingly stable strikeout rates at Double-A Portland. Do Garcia's dwindling strikeouts reflect real, profile-altering improvement in this area? Some of his data suggests not. Garcia is very chase-prone, something that also wasn't evident on his resume until he got regular reps in full-season ball. He's big and strong enough that it's possible his feel for producing power will mimic Teoscar Hernández or Nick Castellanos, who produced like you'd want a Top 100 Prospect to despite a lot of chase and strikeouts. This grade puts Garcia just outside the overall Top 100 due to fears that his chase will be exploited more by prolonged exposure to upper-level pitching."
Aidan Smith,CF,TBR,2028,,40+,High,20.7,40,40,45,60,"Smith got a cool $1.2 million as Seattle's 2023 fourth rounder and was in the middle of his first full season when he was traded to Tampa Bay as part of the Randy Arozarena deal. His impressive combined batting line between the two orgs — .288/.401/.473 —  was good enough for a 139 wRC+. 
The rail-thin Smith is an above-average athlete with above-average physical projection. He has the prototypical outfielder's high-waisted, tapered frame, and he has the speed to develop in center field, but he isn't a polished defender there right now. Though Smith has some exciting, nascent ability on offense (such as his super loose hitting hands), he lacks barrel feel, and we caution readers against taking his 2024 surface stats at face value. Smith's lever length causes him to inside-out a lot of fastballs, and though he was pulling the ball more often in 2024 than he was as an amateur, he's still late to the contact point a lot of the time and his swing often isn't well-connected. This is a developmental outfield prospect who needs to add strength, which will hopefully allow him to have a more consistent and authoritative swing. If the strength really comes then maybe we're talking something in the Jake Marisnick-to-Mitch Haniger range."
Gage Workman,3B,CHC,2025,,40,High,25.4,20,40,40,55,"Relegated to third base because some of his college teammates were really great shortstop defenders, Workman has successfully moved up the defensive spectrum as a pro; he is now an above-average shortstop defender and a 70-grade glove at third. Workman’s footwork and actions are incredible for a player his size. At a long-torso’d 6-foot-4, he has remarkable body control and an impact arm. 
There are old scouting tropes about big-framed hitters and switch-hitters tending to develop late. Workman was both. He struggled to make contact for his whole career and struck out 38% of the time at Double-A in 2023, a terrifying rate. In 2024, at age 25, Workman made real progress in this area. He ditched hitting from the right side and his 27.5% K% was the lowest since he was at Low-A; he hit a BABIP-aided .280/.366/.476 with 18 home runs back at Erie. He has above-average raw power but is still whiffing a ton, especially against breaking stuff, and he'll likely continue to strike out so much that it limits his big league role. But with the Cubs corner infield situation currently up in the air, he has an opportunity to play such great defense that he wins the job at the hot corner coming out of camp. His long-term role is as a strikeout prone utility infielder."
Spencer Giesting,MIRP,ARI,2026,,40,Med,23.7,,,,,"Giesting (rhymes with bee sting) was a young-for-the-class over-slot 11th rounder from UNC Charlotte who had some dominant outings late in the 2022 college season. The Diamondbacks have toned down his max-effort, head-banging delivery, and Giesting took a leap as a strike-thrower in 2024 (despite a big workload increase up to 141.1 IP), reaching Double-A midway through the season. 
Giesting's best pitch continues to be his plus, low-80s slider, which has nasty two-plane movement and which limited lefties to a .403 OPS in 2024. His drop-and-drive style delivery creates uphill angle on his low-90s fastball, enabling it to punch above its weight. This two-pitch combination should at least allow Giesting to be a good lefty reliever, but he still has to flesh out his repertoire to comfortably project as a starter. He can subtract velocity from his slider to present more of a curveball look, but the most promising of Giesting's tertiary offerings is an upper-80s cutter, new in 2024. Giesting can throw it for strikes but needs to polish his location closer to the hands of righties. Either this pitch or Giesting's changeup (which he lacks great feel for) needs to progress for him to fit in a rotation long-term. He remains in swingman limbo but is very likely to be a low-leverage contributor of some kind."
Carlos Pacheco,CF,ATH,2028,,40,Med,20.4,55,50,40,60,"The standout of the A's 2024 extended spring training and complex group was Pacheco, who had two relatively pedestrian seasons of DSL statistical performance coming into 2024. He's a compact speedster with a big time motor and super athletic swing. The springy, tightly wound Pacheco uses the ground well in the box. He's on the smaller side, and there are a lot of young Randy Arozarena similarities to his build and style of play. He is going to wreak havoc on the lower minors with spray, speed, and the way he presses the action on the bases. His speed gives him a shot to develop in center field, and Pacheco probably has a better shot to stay there than he does of adding big power, but that was once also true of Arozarena. Pacheco struck out a little too much for comfort during the 2024 ACL season at 24.5%. He's done that for a couple years in a row, and it's a bit of a red flag K rate for that level. He is otherwise a well-rounded prospect with catalytic qualities, a toolsy dev project whose hit tool needs to improve."
Capri Ortiz,SS,LAA,2027,,40,High,20,35,35,30,70,"Scrawny speedsters like Ortiz often end up moving off of shortstop and out to center field, with Billy Hamilton a prime recent example. But Ortiz's infield defense took a leap in 2024, and he not only looks like a lock to stay at short, he might become an impact glove there. Ortiz's exchange can still be a little slow, but his range is great and his arm strength passes left-side muster. While that's true, Ortiz hasn't really gotten any stronger and it still takes so much effort for his little body to swing hard that he ends up struggling to control the bat. He posted a paltry 64% contact rate in 2024, which is scraping the bottom of the viability barrel. He has only been switch-hitting for a couple of years, and while Ortiz doesn't have ideal body projection because he's such a rail, he should get at least somewhat bigger as he matures, and take a step forward as a hitter via both improved skill and strength. At minimum, he looks like a plus shortstop defender with 70 speed — even with a flawed hit tool, that's a good utility player. His upside will be driven by how much Ortiz develops on offense, so much of which is still TBD as he grows and changes as an athlete."
Rafael Flores,C,NYY,2026,,40,High,24.4,30,30,45,40,"Flores played more games at catcher than first base in 2024, a flip of his 2023 full season debut. The strapping 6-foot-3 backstop has improved enough as a defender to be considered a viable big league catcher, albeit not a great one. Flores' best attribute on defense is his pure arm strength, which he can show off from some tough platforms. He still allowed over 100 stolen bases at an 85% success rate in 2024 because of too many botched exchanges and inaccurate throws, as if he doesn't always have a great grip on the baseball when he lets it go. Flores' pitch framing looks incredible on paper — Synergy Sports has his shadow zone strike rate way up at 70% (though the pitch locations are subjective at Double-A, so a healthy grain of of salt is in order here) — but to the eye, he's a little worse than average. 
On offense, Flores slashed a cartoonish .279/.379/.495 in a season split between High- and Double-A, which is great for a small school undrafted guy in his second full pro season, but a little tougher to contextualize given his age and mature physicality. Flores has plus raw power and he's able to create it in a fairly short mechanical distance. He crushes mistakes and is an explosive rotator, but he isn't a skillful hitter who's making contact all over the zone, as his swing is grooved middle-middle and isn't in the hitting zone for very long. His contact data — 70% contact rate overall, only 76% inside the strike zone — is comfortably below average on the big league scale, and Flores performed that way as a 23-year-old in the mid-minors. I have reservations about Flores' ability to make enough contact to access his power and think he'll be a volatile bat-first backup."
Ethan Bagwell,SP,ATL,2029,,40,High,19.1,,,,,"Bagwell is a very powerful righty with an exciting drop-and-drive delivery and talent for spin. The physical 6-foot-4, 230-pound former Missouri commit drives so hard down the mound that his right shin almost scrapes the ground as he pedals home. Bagwell also has a low-three-quarters arm slot that, combined with his delivery, gives him a 5-foot release height. This creates funky uphill angle on his low-90s fastball, which was up to 96 at the Combine. Bagwell made one post-draft start in Augusta, and his focus seemed to be mixing in two- and four-seamers. His sweeper-style slider at times features 2,800 rpm, and is a potential plus pitch if he can learn to command it. A great-looking delivery, a traits-y fastball, and a plus potential breaking ball — it's a great foundation for a developmental pitching prospect. Bagwell's not traditionally projectable because he's already a muscular 230 pounds, but he checks virtually every other box and has a reasonable relief floor with even a slightly better version of his present stuff."
Drew Romo,C,COL,2025,,40,Low,23.6,50,60,30,40,"After a couple of years during which Romo simply didn't look like his usual self on defense (he allowed an 80% success rate on steals in 2023), things appeared more normal in 2024 as Romo's arm looked average, and his receiving and ball-blocking did too. He posted his second consecutive upper-level season with a 104 wRC+ and made his big league debut. 
Romo has the tools of a backup catcher. He's a solid if unspectacular defensive catcher now that his arm strength has mostly returned (though his throws back to the pitcher are still odd looking), and he looked comfortable catching big league stuff late in 2024. Romo is a plus contact hitter with below-average bat speed, and his hit tool and game power both play down a bit because he's an overly aggressive swinger. The strapping lad should play a well-rounded backup role for a very long time."
Kelvis Salcedo,SP,DET,2028,,40,High,19.2,,,,,"Salcedo is a bigger-bodied righty whose mid-90s fastball features nasty natural cut; he also has a sinker variant with a little less movement. Salcedo's mid-80s sweeper features plus-plus spin and late movement, which helped him strike out 28.9% of DSL hitters in 2024, and some of his breaking balls have slider velo and curveball depth. The 2024 campaign was Salcy's second season down in the DSL, and he is relatively maxed out for a pitcher his age. His profile includes substantial relief risk because of his build alone, but his stuff is nasty enough to consider him a priority teenage pitching prospect in the org."
Dakota Jordan,CF,SFG,2028,,35+,High,21.9,30,30,50,70,"Jordan is an incredibly physical power-hitting prospect who was a 2024 draft-eligible sophomore with a very, very concerning strikeout rate. Despite striking out 29% of the time at Mississippi State, Jordan still posted a 1.129 OPS. He has a rare raw power and speed combo, which was enough for the Giants to pay him just under $2 million in the fourth round of last year’s draft. 
Jordan's swing leaves him very vulnerable to high heat and he probably needs a swing change if he's going to hit. He also can't lay off spin, which could be an issue even if he magically develops a kinematically perfect swing. He seemed to be using a more upright set-up after the draft compared to the crouched stance he had in college. Jordan's swing produces low ball loft versus soft stuff, and he has incredible all-fields power. He will also run the occasional sub-4.2 to first base at 220 pounds; it's eye-popping to see someone this big move that fast on a baseball field. Jordan primarily handled the outfield corners as an amateur, but his plus foot speed will give him a shot to handle all three outfield spots in the future. This is a high-variance college prospect who is essentially a very toolsy dev project in all facets."
Devin Saltiban,CF,PHI,2028,,35+,High,20.1,30,30,55,60,"It's logistically difficult for Hawaiian position player prospects to travel to the mainland for a ton of showcase activity, so it was Saltiban's showing in the 2023 MLB Draft League and that year's Draft Combine that first put him on FanGraphs' radar. The Phillies gave him a little over $600,000 to sign. 
I had Saltiban written up as an outfielder prior to the draft because he didn't seem to have the hands for the infield. Given his relative lack of experience, it made sense for the Phillies to at least see if he could develop as an infielder, so he played shortstop after signing and second base in 2024. He's still too mistake-prone to consider a viable infield prospect, but Saltiban is a plus runner and I think his best chance of playing an up-the-middle position is to deploy him in center field. 
Saltiban is built like a little running back and has an exciting power/speed combo, which allowed him to hit 17 bombs in Clearwater last year, a couple of which went out to the opposite field. He has a very authoritative top hand through contact and is capable of turning on fastballs up around his hands, but he struggles to recognize sliders. Saltiban is perhaps the highest variance prospect in this system. There's a chance he doesn't make enough contact to be anything at all, but there's also a chance he's a 20-homer center fielder in spite of a ton of strikeouts. Because his position is still totally up in the air, Saltiban remains more of a toolsy dev project than a true impact prospect, even though he has that kind of ceiling."
Jose Urbina,SP,TBR,2028,,40+,High,19.4,,,,,"Urbina's stuff climbed throughout 2024; he was sitting 92-94 at the end of May, but by the end of the season, he was sitting 94-97 for five innings at a time. Combined between the complex level and four Low-A starts at the end of the season, he worked 65 innings, struck out 57, and walked 29, but 10 of those walks came in just two of Urbina's outings, and he walked just four batters combined in the final month of the season. In addition to plus velocity, Urbina has a potentially plus bullet-style slider, which was parked in the 85-88 mph range late in the year. He worked more with a low-80s curveball early in the season, but by the end of the year, that pitch was relegated to strike-stealing duty. The fastball/slider combo of a good middle reliever is already here, and Urbina seems to be evolving rapidly as a strike-thrower. If he can find a splitter or changeup during the next couple of seasons, he'll more comfortably have a starter's mix. At the rate he developed in 2024, that seems pretty feasible."
Yahil Melendez,SS,CHC,2028,,40,High,19.6,50,40,45,40,"Melendez signed for $400,000 as a seventh rounder rather than go to Rice, and he's one of quite a few interesting young hitters who were part of Chicago's Arizona complex group in 2024, slashing .268/.395/.425 with 19 extra-base hits in 53 games. Melendez already has some of the most exciting power in the Cubs org. He has slightly above-average measurable raw pop already as a teenager (he turned 19 just after the season), he has rare size for a potential shortstop at a strapping 6-foot-3, and he also has an unusually compact swing and shorter levers than most hitters this size do. 
Melendez isn't the bendiest athlete and plays the game with a high center of gravity, which is evident both in his swing and on defense. This limits his ability to reach a lot of softer stuff in the bottom of he zone, which we worry will be a growing issue as he climbs. Melendez's bat path just doesn't allow him to scoop these pitches; he either needs to change that or get deeper into his lower body to connect with them, and it makes flexibility the key visual piece of Melendez's evaluation to monitor. This issue extends to Melendez's defense. At his size, he may not be a long-term fit at short no matter what, but his hands and feel for defense have improved during his year-and-a-half of pro ball. He's a pessimistic ""maybe"" at short. 
Lefty-hitting infielders with this kind of power projection don't exactly grow on trees, but Melendez is volatile because of the hole in his swing, and he struck out quite a bit on the complex (28.4%). He has the upside that we'd typically associate with 40+ FV prospect, but the third base and strikeout risk here has us rounding down a touch."
Will Klein,SIRP,SEA,2025,,40,Med,25.3,,,,,"Klein came to the A’s in the Lucas Erceg deal at the 2024 trade deadline and then was sent to Seattle for International bonus pool space in January 2025. His profile revolves around his 95-98 mph fastball, which touches triple digits and features plus riding life through the zone. Klein's ability to harness his heater in the zone remains spotty. In his 50.1 frames between Triple-A and the big leagues, he walked 16.5% of opposing batters while also striking them out at a 21.7% clip, lower than you'd hope given his stuff. Klein’s curveball is a short, vertical breaker between 85-87 mph that will show solid bite but ultimately is hindered by his inability to land it with consistency. He'll also mix in a shorter breaker in the upper-80s that has a hint of horizontal tilt to it; it's on the slider/cutter line. The caliber of Klein’s pure stuff is in line with many high-leverage relief types, but the volatility in his strike-throwing ability makes him better suited for a bridge relief role."
Jorge Barrosa,CF,ARI,2025,,40,Low,24.1,60,60,30,55,"The 5-foot-6 Barrosa became the shortest player in the majors when he debuted early in 2024 due to an Alek Thomas injury; he was previously over-listed at 5-foot-9, until the ABS implementation in the minors forced a correction. Skilled and entertaining as hell, Barrosa is a plus contact hitter and capable center field defender with highlight reel ball skills, but perhaps dwindling range. His general athleticism took a bit of a step back in 2024, which was most noticeable on defense, where Barrosa wasn't covering quite as much ground. His creativity at the catch point is still special, but overall he looked more average than plus on defense in 2024, which is the chief reason his grade slides a bit here compared to our last update. 
Barrosa's swing has a lot of big movement and noise in his hands, which he gets away with because he's so small — it's basically impossible for a guy his height to have a long swing. He's been a plus contact hitter for his entire minor league career and is really cooking when he's spraying doubles from line-to-line. Barrosa is chase-prone, which puts a dent in his overall output and projection as a team's fifth outfielder. His ability to pinch run, put the ball in play when you need it, and act as a defensive replacement in the corners should give him enough utility to be rostered consistently."
Shane Smith,SIRP,CHW,2025,,40,Med,25,,,,,"Smith had Tommy John during his draft year and signed as an undrafted free agent in 2021. Back from rehab in the fall of 2022, he was 93-95 mph with a good curveball and spotty control. His velocity took a leap in 2023, as he was sitting 94-97 at the end of the season, and he carried that velocity into the start of 2024 before the Brewers moved him from the bullpen into the Double-A Biloxi rotation. That’s when Smith’s fastball dipped backed into the 93-95 mph range, and even when Milwaukee returned the 24-year-old to the bullpen at the end of the year, it still hung there. Smith should at least have adequate big league reliever velocity, and perhaps more than that if his arm strength rebounds. He began re-incorporating sliders and cutters into his pitch mix in 2024 after he was mostly fastball/curveball in 2023. His curveball did not perform as well in 2024 as it did in 2023, and it’s plausible that his repertoire will be pared down if Smith ends up in Chicago’s bullpen right away. Milwaukee’s experimentation with Smith as a starter was a worthy endeavor but, realistically, he’s going to be a fairly standard middle reliever with two plus pitches."
Jack Perkins,SIRP,ATH,2026,,40,Med,25.3,,,,,"Perkins has pitched through Double-A (and had bat-missing success) as a starter, but his inability to stay healthy or throw strikes has him funneled toward the bullpen in this projection. Perkins sits 93-95 as a starter and his fastball has bat-missing ride. If he has a velo spike in relief, it will be a comfortably plus pitch. Perkins' slider already is, though his release variability impacts the pitch's consistency and quality. Perkins also has a cutter, a curveball, and a changeup, with each representing a smaller portion of his repertoire than the fastball and slider by quite a bit. He may pare that down if indeed he moves to the bullpen, a change that's in play in 2025 and 2026, as Perkins is likely to ascend to the 40-man roster."
Michael Darrell-Hicks,SIRP,LAA,2025,,40,Low,27.4,,,,,"A 2022 undrafted free agent from Jacksonville University, Darrell-Hicks moved to the bullpen full-time in 2024 and thrived in a multi-inning role as a strike-throwing sinker/slider/cutter guy; he reached Salt Lake in the middle of the season. He fills the zone with greater consistency than most relievers, his fastball has enough sink to stay off of barrels (Darrell-Hicks generated a 53.6% groundball rate in his 20.2 Triple-A innings), and he commands his two distinct breaking balls (both of which are above-average) with aplomb. This was a nice pickup for the Angels. Darrell-Hicks has a good shot to make his big league debut late in 2025 and compete for a lower-leverage middle-inning role thereafter."
Everson Pereira,CF,NYY,2025,,40,High,24,30,30,50,50,"Last year, I wrote about my substantial concerns with regards to Pereira's ability to make contact and his long-term physical projection. I had him evaluated less enthusiastically than what readers may have anticipated given that he was coming off a season in which the 22-year-old slugged .548 and hit 18 homers in 81 games against upper-level pitching. That's because Pereira, who briefly debuted in 2023, has struck out at a nearly 30% clip his entire minor league career, his hands aren't particularly deft or precise, and his swing is kind of stiff and clunky in a way that leaves him vulnerable to several common pitch type/location combinations (especially fastballs up). 
In 2024, Pereira was on a similar path when his elbow blew out and he needed the internal brace style of Tommy John, ending his season. Before that, Pereira slashed .265/.346/.512 and hit 10 homers in 40 games, but again struck out in about a third of his plate appearances. He swung and missed nearly 40% more often than he put balls in play (141 swinging strikes, 103 balls in play) when an even split would be a dicey sign. There is enormous bust risk here, though Pereira should get to enough power to be a relevant (but frustrating) extra outfielder. The 2025 season will be Pereira's final option year barring some kind of exemption related to his injury."
Luis Arestigueta,SP,ATL,2028,,40,Med,19.5,,,,,"Arestigueta checks several visual scouting boxes with his projectable 6-foot-3 build, and his mechanical grace and fluidity. He pitched his way off the complex in 2024, ending his season at Low-A Augusta and totaling 60.1 combined innings between the two levels (and probably more during extended spring training) with a 21.5% K% and 10.9% BB%. Though his stuff is currently below average across the board, Arestigueta's projectability and relative polish for his age make him a nice developmental starter prospect. His fastball averaged just 90 mph in 2024, but it peaks in the 94-95 area. Given his age, he might end up sitting more in the mid-90s at maturity. Arestigueta also has a good low-80s slider with two-planed movement, which generated a 39% miss rate in 2024. His changeup is well behind his slider, but Arestigueta's silky smooth arm action should yield a better one with time. This is a nice low-level prospect who'd be in the third round mix were he in the draft."
Jaden Hill,SIRP,COL,2025,,40,High,25.3,,,,,"Hill was an exciting high school prospect with a low-90s fastball and a plus changeup, but wildness helped funnel him to LSU, where he experienced a huge velo spike. Multiple injuries, including a 2021 Tommy John, prevented Hill from pitching enough to prove that he had bettered his command. He was developed as a starter in 2022 and during the 2023 regular season after he had returned from his TJ rehab. He battled shoulder soreness in 2023 and picked up reps in the Arizona Fall League as a reliever. His stuff took a leap, with his fastball up about three ticks into the 97-99 mph range, while both of Hill's mid-80s secondary offerings flashed plus or better. Hill entered 2024 as a pure reliever, dominated Double-A, and reached the big leagues. 
Though Hill has three plus pitches, he's a little too wild to trust in high-leverage spots. He's nearly a sidearm thrower whose fastball tails, sometimes way, way in on righties. His changeup also has a lot of tailing action, and the horizontal split between his slider and his two other pitches forces hitters to deal with a tough combination of east/west movement, though his lack of command doesn't enable these pitches to consistently play to their full potential. Hill projects as a feast-or-famine middle reliever."
Joseph Montalvo,SP,DET,2026,,40,Low,22.9,,,,,"Montalvo is a slender 6-foot-2 righty who came to Detroit from Texas in last year's Andrew Chafin trade. He was dominating the Sally League with Hickory — 59 IP, 2.44 ERA — before he tore a ligament in his foot and landed on the IL for the month leading up to the trade; he was less dominant after the deal, but he still threw strikes at West Michigan. Across the entire season, Montalvo worked 78 innings and had a 3.00 ERA, a 27.2% strikeout rate and an 8% walk rate. 
This is a high-floored fifth starter prospect. Montalvo sits in the low-90s with above-average rise/run action, and he tends to command his heater to the upper arm-side quadrant of the zone. His bullet-style slider, which resides in the 81-85 mph range, is his best pitch. He commands it to his glove side and it generated a 43% miss rate in 2024. He also has a mid-80s changeup that flashes bat-missing tail, but it tends to have early action that puts hitters off the scent, and Montalvo uses it sparingly. Though he's a graceful athlete who repeats his delivery well, Montalvo's arm action is so curt that it's quite deliberate and not especially fluid or natural looking. How this will impact his ability to develop a better changeup is tough to say; at the very least, he should be able to command it better over time. Montalvo should spend most of 2025 at Double-A Erie and is a postseason 40-man candidate on track to make some spot starts in 2026."
Henry Baez,SP,SDP,2026,,35+,Low,22.5,,,,,"Baez is a strike-throwing 21-year-old righty with a standard 6-foot-3 build and a generic but repeatable delivery. He's threw a ton of strikes at Fort Wayne and had a 3-to-1 K-to-BB ratio before he was promoted to San Antonio late in the year. Nothing happening here is plus. Baez sits 92-95 with downhill plane. He has a vertical curveball and a mid-80s splitter that both look average to the eye and performed a shade above that. He's a fair athlete with modest physical projection, and is tracking like an eventual spot starter type."
Bo Davidson,CF,SFG,2028,,35+,High,22.7,30,30,45,50,"Chanteyon Ajria ""Bo"" Davidson was a nice undrafted pickup out of a North Carolina JUCO, a lefty power bat who has slowly come along at the bottom of San Francisco's system. He spent all of 2023 on the complex and then played the 2024 season in San Jose before going to the Arizona Fall League. Davidson posted a 173 wRC+ in the Cal League, and while it's prudent to adjust one's sense of that given his age, let's remember this is a Division-II JUCO prospect who has only just begun to face good pitching on a regular basis. Davidson's swing tends to spray the ball to the opposite field and he might be entirely too late against upper level stuff, but he has real lefty juice. He's also a surprisingly competent center field defender despite average speed. Especially if he can keep developing in center, there will be room for Davidson's strikeouts to breath given how much juice he has. He's a good sleeper toward the bottom of the system."
Enrique Segura,SP,PHI,2028,,35+,High,20.3,,,,,"Segura is a very projectable 6-foot-3 righty with an open-striding, low-slot delivery that creates tailing, uphill action on his low-90s fastball. He's a nightmare for opposing righties because of his arm slot, which makes it tough for them to see his slider. Segura's changeup feel is good for a pitcher his age, and he's a loose, lanky athlete who stands a good chance to throw harder as he matures. There's a relief path for him that looks more like Miguel Castro, but for now Segura looks like a developmental starter who climbs into this FV tier because he has such a good looking delivery and projectable build."
Trevor Harrison,SP,TBR,2028,,40+,High,19.6,,,,,"Harrison was a local high schooler committed to Florida State who signed for just shy of $850,000. He didn't pitch after the 2023 draft and was somewhat conservatively assigned to the Complex League to start 2024. He ended up splitting his innings between Port Charlotte and Low-A Charleston, combining for 72.2 IP, a 3.34 ERA, a 1.24 WHIP and a 29.4% strikeout rate. Harrison overwhelmed hitters with mid-90s velocity and a plus-flashing changeup. He's a bigger, more physically mature righty, with an innings-eating 6-foot-4 frame. Harrison has a rather upright delivery, his fastball has downhill plane and tailing movement, and he could have a sinker that's a nightmare for righties. Since Harrison is of relatively mature build, we might not see much more velocity than he's currently working with. Instead, his key area of development will be slider quality and consistency. His slider is firm, often 85-87 mph, but it has variable depth and finish. Harrison's changeup has action that pairs nicely with the sink of his fastball, and the pitch had an absurd miss rate in a fairly small 2024 sample. Still a great distance from the bigs, Harrison is a developmental workhorse starter."
Benjamin Cowles,SS,CHC,2025,,40,Low,25.1,40,40,45,50,"Cowles came to Chicago in the Mark Leiter Jr. trade at the 2024 deadline and was added to the 40-man after the season. He posted a 142 wRC+ at Double-A Somerset prior to the trade (he broke his wrist days before he was dealt) and picked up reps in the Arizona Fall League, where he looked good at shortstop and was getting to power. Cowles' improved 2024 strikeout rate is a bit of a mirage; he's a power-over-hit type of guy with roughly average thump that he gets to because of the loft in his swing. A capable shortstop defender, Cowles is similar to Zack Short and should play a similar sixth infielder utility role."
Tim Tawa,1B,ARI,2025,,40,Med,26,35,40,50,40,"A multi-sport prospect in high school, Tawa was a high-profile Stanford commit who had a great freshman year and then struggled as a sophomore and during his COVID-shortened junior year. He returned for his senior season, set several career highs, and became Arizona's first Day Three pick in 2021. Tawa has hit for a ton of power in the upper levels of the minors (including 31 homers in 2024) with the help of the hitting environments at Double-A Amarillo (a wind tunnel) and Triple-A Reno (the surface of the moon). He is on time to pull mistakes with power, and he's gotten enough of those to club 53 homers combined in 2023 and 2024. As the Diamondbacks searched for a viable position for Tawa, he inadvertently backed into meaningful defensive versatility. He is best at first base, while being below average at the other infield positions (Tawa basically stopped playing second base in the middle of 2024) and in the outfield corners. His versatility makes him a great fit for up/down duty in the event of injuries at the big league level."
Anthony Maldonado,SIRP,ATH,2025,,40,Med,26.7,,,,,"A very successful three-year starter at Bethune-Cookman, Maldonado's pro career began on a bit of a delay because of the pandemic and an injury that cost him a large chunk of 2021. Despite that, he reached the upper levels of the minors in a relief role very quickly, and he's been dominant from a bat-missing and strike-throwing standpoint for the last couple of years before finally debuting in the majors in 2024 with Miami. He was claimed off waivers after the season. Maldonado hangs his hat on a mid-80s slider that has powerful vertical finish. He throws this pitch more than half the time and supplements it with a low-90s sinker that stays out of trouble because of Maldonado's control. He's begun to incorporate a cutter in order to keep hitters off his fastball, mostly against lefties. Consistent slider command is his ticket to a steady low-leverage relief role."
Jose Fermin,SIRP,LAA,2025,,40,High,23.3,,,,,"Fermin signed a month shy of his 22nd birthday, which is practically ancient for an international prospect. His 2024 debut season was messy but electric. He raced through both A-ball levels and ended the season at Double-A Rocket City. During his second half at Tri-City, Fermin was striking out a whopping 40% of opposing hitters. He has a high-effort, open-stride delivery that generates a 94-97 mph fastball with plus vertical break. More effective than his fastball is Fermin's 84-88 mph gyro slider, which has nasty vertical movement for a pitch as hard as it is. All the effort in Fermin's delivery makes him very wild, wild enough that he projects to middle relief rather than the late-inning role in which his stuff could conceivably play. If he can curb his walks against upper-level hitters in 2025, he'll quickly have made a case to be on the big league roster."
Brock Selvidge,SP,NYY,2026,,40,High,22.6,,,,,"Like a lot of Yankees pitching prospects, Selvidge has quickly leaned into throwing his best pitch most often, and he continued to track like a fifth starter/swingman type in 2024 before he was shut down with biceps inflammation in early July. Selvidge lacks pinpoint command, but all of his big, 6-foot-3 frame hurdles directly toward the plate, and allows him to land his slider in the zone consistently. It has tight enough movement to play like a plus pitch even though Selvidge lacks feel for locating it as a chaseable offering; his slider tends to live in the zone even with two strikes. Selvidge has flashed plus fastball velocity in the past, but as he's worked a pro pitcher's slate of innings, he has settled into the 91-94 mph range. He relies on his fastball's rare spin and mechanical deception to get by, and lives on the arm-side half of the plate with his fastball and a decent, tailing changeup. Durability is a big part of Selvidge's prospectdom. He worked 127.2 innings in 2023 and was on pace to go more like 140-150 before he was shut down in 2024; he was pitching fairly well at Somerset and was comfortably on track for a post-2025 40-man add before the injury. Here he's still projected as a low-variance fifth starter."
John Gil,SS,ATL,2029,,40,High,18.9,40,40,45,60,"Gil, who signed for $110,000 in 2023, has had two solid offensive seasons in rookie ball and hit his way to Low-A late last season. Still, a .286/.403/.389 line on the North Port complex doesn't present an accurate representation of Gil's offensive skill set. He's patient and has pretty good power for a hitter his age (35% hard-hit rate, 103 mph EV90), but he really struggled to hit after he was promoted to Augusta at the end of 2024. There is strikeout risk here, as Gil lacks barrel feel and tends to swing through the middle of the zone. But if he can get to more power (his swing also presently lacks launch) and walk a bunch, that should allow him to play a utility role. Gil's carrying tools are his speed and his shortstop defense. He's a comfortably plus runner who stole 40 bases in 48 attempts last year. His speed gives him explosive range, and Gil's ability to make acrobatic defensive plays gives him a shot to be an impact shortstop defender at peak. His path to a large role comes via his defense. Any chance Gil has of being an everyday player will come from him out-performing my hit tool projection here."
Mike Sirota,CF,LAD,2027,,40,Med,21.8,40,40,50,60,"Speedy, power-over-hit center field prospect with plus plate discipline. Tightly wound athlete with narrow build, wiry and strong. Hands are especially lively with low-ball power. Likely going to swing underneath a ton of in-zone fastballs and be a below-average contact hitter. Speed fits in center; reads and routes need polish but the footspeed is there. Projected issues with the hit tool and Sirota's flavor of build/athleticism look more like a part-timer. His on-base ability buoys his profile and gives Sirota a shot to be a Tyrone Taylor type of complimentary outfielder."
Andy Perez,SS,COL,2028,,40,High,20.8,50,60,45,50,"Perez is a slow-burning, projectable, 6-foot-3 shortstop who makes terrific rates of contact despite an over-aggressive approach. In 2024, Perez repeated Low-A and found a new gear of power as he more than tripled his career home run total with 10 bombs on the year. Perez's combination of a lanky build and physical projection is very exciting and atypical for someone who has maintained plus contact rates as a pro (91% in the zone and 82% overall in 2024). Though Perez is often late to the contact point and his chase is scary (40%, essentially 30-grade plate discipline), he has had bat-to-ball success despite his issues for each of his four pro seasons, and he makes a plus rate of contact outside the zone. He's a great bender for an athlete his size, and so long as he adds arm strength as his frame fills out, which might also yield more power, he has a decent shot to remain at shortstop for the long haul. Much of Perez's profile is still magmatic, but potentially viable shortstops with this kind of size and contact feel are uncommon. Perez is a good long-term prospect of rather extreme variance, with his right tail outcomes that of a regular shortstop."
Max Anderson,2B,DET,2026,,40,Med,23.1,35,40,50,50,"“I like to swing, it’s not a secret,” is both a favorite old José Abreu quote and the operating ethos of Anderson, the former second rounder who let it fly two standard deviations more often than the average minor leaguer in his first year of pro ball. Despite his clear predilections, which trickle all the way down to a combative two-strike approach and combine with a clearly demonstrated hole in his coverage against velocity above the belt, the burly second baseman posted the sixth-lowest strikeout rate in the Midwest League while spending the vast majority of the year at High-A West Michigan and slashing .270/.321/.392.
For someone who faced plenty of questions about his unorthodox swing after emerging as a pop-up prospect in his junior year in Lincoln, Anderson puts a lot of balls in play with a purpose (45% hard-hit rate), and while he’s not the most projectable athlete, his top-end exit velocities are already solidly in line with the big league average. But Anderson’s deeply crouched chop of a swing produces almost no pull-side airborne contact, and practically never against velocity. A groundball rate north of 50% and an aggressive approach hunting for pitches thigh-high and below are further impediments to his power playing up in games.
Anderson is a 40 runner, and his movement at second base is similarly limited. While he doesn't have a standout arm, it’s suitable for action if Anderson returns to third base, his primary position in college, which could fuel an existence as a multi-position reserve. Still, a full season spent at Double-A Erie figures to be less forgiving to his demonstrated weakness against elevated velocity."
Robert Hassell III,CF,WSN,2025,,35+,Low,23.6,45,55,40,55,"Hassell hasn't slugged over .371 at any level since coming over from the Padres as part of the Juan Soto deal. He's still about as big and strong as he was when he was drafted, which has left him with 40-grade power at age 23. Especially for a tweener defender, that's not enough for an everyday profile. Hassell was struggling with strikeouts late in 2023, and while that improved a good bit in 2024 (he only struck out in 21% of his Double-A plate appearances compared to 31% in 2023), it's not enough to give Hassell a water-carrying hit tool, either. He looks like an up/down outfielder right now."
Jose Bello,SP,SFG,2029,,35+,Med,19.8,,,,,"Dominant in his second DSL season, the Giants promoted Bello to Arizona for one start in late July; in total, he struck out 38 and walked five across 27.2 innings. Bello has a starter's mix with three potentially average or better pitches, the best of which is his 82-85 mph, two-planed slider. Bello has a quick arm and throws strikes despite having a long arm action. His release's inconsistency manifests more in the variable movement of his pitches. Some of his fastballs cut a little bit while others tail, and Bello throws his fair share of non-competitive changeups, but the cambio also flashes bat-missing action. Though a tad undersized, Bello is a good athlete and fine developmental prospect whose realistic outcome is that of a backend starter."
Mavis Graves,SP,PHI,2027,,35+,Low,21.4,,,,,"After Graves struggled badly with walks during his 2023 pro debut, he now looks like a very stable high-volume strike-thrower with modest present stuff and projection, a long-term backend starter. Graves is a massive 6-foot-6 and his delivery is so easy and effortless that it almost look lackadaisical. His consistent release allows Graves to fill the zone with four pitches, the best of which is his tight (albeit a little slow) two-planed slider. It's tough to see Graves adding significant velocity as he matures because he's already so massive, and he's not an especially twitchy athlete. This is why he's considered a fairly low-variance prospect despite his age and measurables."
Keyner Benitez,SP,MIA,2027,,45,High,18.9,,,,,"Benitez doesn't have big present velocity, but everything else he brings to the table is promising and exciting. He is extremely lanky and projectable, he has electric arm speed, he attacks hitters with remarkable efficiency for a pitcher his age, and his secondary stuff is good. After dominating the complex early in 2024, Benitez was promoted to Low-A Jupiter and worked just shy of 70 innings combined, though he likely threw more when you factor in extended spring training. 
Benitez mixes four- and two-seamers in the 90-93 mph range, and even though he's only 6-foot-1, his level of athleticism and body projection augur velocity gains as he matures. This guy has serious arm speed; it's very difficult to pick up the ball out of Benitez's hand and it gets on hitters fast. It also helps hide his very advanced changeup, a low-80s offering with late sinking action and tail. Benitez seemed to be using a higher arm slot for his breaking ball late in the year, and how that pitch will evolve is uncertain. It has plenty of length and depth, but currently lacks power in the 77-80 mph range. The foundation for a backend starter is already here, and Benitez's ceiling is going to be most influenced by how much velocity he grows into. Both his control and his level of athleticism for his age are very, very exciting components that make you want to put your thumb on the FV scale more than is typical for a teenage pitcher who's sitting 91."
Dylan Lesko,SP,TBR,2028,,40+,High,21.6,,,,,"Lesko was one of the nastier high school pitching prospects of the last 10 years, with riding mid-90s velocity and the best high school changeup a lot of scouts had ever seen. A pre-draft Tommy John precipitated a draft day fall to San Diego, deep in the first round. Upon his return from TJ, Lesko's stuff was intact, but his command was gone. He walked 16.5% of opposing hitters in the Padres system last year, and then his walk rate exploded to 31.1% after he was traded to the Rays as part of the Jason Adam swap. 
Lesko simply cannot find the zone right now. His release point is all over the place, and no matter what pitch he tries to lay in there, he just can't control it. Toward the end of 2024, opposing hitters were just standing in the box, visibly checked out, waiting for their free pass. Even if he had the nastiest stuff on the planet, Lesko would be struggling to get outs with his current lack of command. He needs to find at least one more grade of control to reach the big leagues, and probably two if he's going to stay there for very long. Realistically, Lesko projects as a changeup-heavy reliever in the Tommy Kahnle mold, with a dominant Devin Williams-style role (yes, Lesko's changeup is that good) as the right tail outcome if his control gets to a place where he can be trusted in do-or-die situations."
Juan Cabada,SS,CHC,2031,,40,High,16.9,55,55,45,55,"Cabada has one of the more polished and stable hit tools in the 2025 international class. He's of compact build, has quick wrists, and sprays authoritative line drives into the gaps. Though he's not especially big, his best swings make the most of his body and produce some dangerous pull-side power. Cabada also runs well and has a good arm, enough that he has a shot to stick at shortstop (but isn't a lock there). He could be a Yonathan Perlaza type of player if things don't work out at shortstop, and a good part-time, multipositional player if they do. Truly big impact might be tough for Cabada to come by due to a lack of size."
Pedro Catuy,CF,ARI,2028,,40,High,19.2,35,40,50,60,"Catuy's precocious center field defense and ideal physical projection make him a potential long-term power/glove dynamo. He slashed .288/.361/.441 in the 2023 DSL, stole 18 bases in 20 attempts, and only struck out 17.2% of the time. He didn't get into an affiliated game this season after suffering a left LCL injury on a slide into home during extended spring training that required surgery. In his early 2024 backfield evaluation, Catuy, the youngest hitter on Arizona's extended spring roster, had a defense-first look. His reads and routes are easy and comfortable, as Catuy glides into the gaps and catches the baseball with uncommon ease. His speed was also evident on the bases. Catuy has nearly average bat speed, which is good for an 18-year-old with as much room for muscle as he has. His swing is pretty simple and not especially dynamic; he typically cuts through the middle of the zone with gentle loft and just looks like he's trying to be on time. His swing could get more athletic and incorporate more movement as he gets comfortable facing pro stuff. Catuy has an exciting tools/projection package and could break out in 2025 or 2026 once he's healthy and playing regularly enough to develop some as a hitter."
Daniel Susac,C,ATH,2027,,40,High,23.9,35,40,45,30,"Susac spent all of 2024 in Midland, where he posted a respectable .257/.300/.434 line despite chasing over 40% of the time. His inability to parse balls and strikes is extreme. Susac had 370 trips to the plate last season and only walked 16 times (4.3%), and though he has pretty good plate coverage, he still struck out at a 25.9% clip because of all the chase. Susac's power is still pretty good for a catcher and he tallied 34 extra-base hits on the year, but it's tough to expect him to get to his power in games when he's expanding the zone this much. Behind the dish, Susac moves around well and is a relatively quiet pitch receiver. His ball-blocking still needs a lot of work and his exit from his crouch is inconsistent and impacts his pop times, which are fine when he has a clean exchange. He's a flawed third catcher at this point."
Camden Minacci,SIRP,LAA,2026,,40,Med,23.2,,,,,"The former Wake Forest closer was drafted by the Angels in the sixth round after striking out 34.3% of opposing batters in his final collegiate season. Minacci is a standard fastball/slider middle relief prospect who throws from a high three-quarters slot with significant effort in his delivery. His four-seamer, which averaged 95 mph in 2024 and has touched 97 mph, will flash late action; his mid-80s slider relies on the lateness of its break more than the amount of movement it shows. Minacci split 2024 between High- and Double-A, where he struck out 31.5% of opposing hitters. He is on pace to debut at some point in the middle of 2026."
Roc Riggio,2B,NYY,2026,,40,Med,22.8,40,40,45,50,"Riggio became famous when he committed to UCLA ridiculously early (he was in eighth grade). He didn't end up a Bruin and instead matriculated to Oklahoma State, where he hit very well for two years as he embraced a sort of grinder/heel persona. He ended up slashing .316/.438/.601 in two seasons for the Cowboys, then .221/.349/.397 with 11 home runs and 27 steals at High-A Hudson Valley in his first full season. Lefty-hitting infielders with this kind of bat speed are uncommon, and Riggio is no slouch as a defender, either, even though he is likely limited to second base. A lack of plate coverage and barrel control is a byproduct of the effort with which Riggio swings. While he sports hit tool risk, there are some Rougned Odor similarities here, though a Kody Clemens and Cavan Biggio type of role is probably more likely."
Anderson Pilar,SIRP,ATL,2025,,40,Med,27.1,,,,,"The 27-year-old Pilar signed with the Rockies toward the end of 2015 and was in their org until after the 2023 season, when he elected free agency. He signed with the Marlins on a minor league deal and missed a chunk of 2024 in the middle of the season due to injury, but reached Triple-A in a long relief role late in the year. Pilar then went to the Dominican Winter League, which is where his prospect stock took off, as he lowered his arm slot and added a few ticks to his entire repertoire. He was sitting 95 with natural cut the day before the Rule 5 Draft, when he was selected by the Braves, after sitting 93 during the regular season. Pilar works with cutters and sliders and has maintained half of last year's velo bump at the onset of 2025; he's sitting 94 in Grapefruit League action. His slider looks like it has more consistent depth now, and he has a sinker variant in addition to the two glove-side offerings. He looks like a solid middle-inning option."
Jared Thomas,LF,COL,2027,,40,High,21.7,40,40,50,50,"Thomas was a draft-eligible sophomore who posted a career .336/.418/.565 line at Texas with an 18% strikeout rate. He barely played affiliated ball after the draft. Thomas has an ideal baseball frame at a super projectable 6-foot-2; he has above-average power to both gaps and is going to grow into more. His dynamic low-ball swing plays best when Thomas' bat path is vertical; it tends to be too long when he has to flatten it out to catch fastballs away from him. His power can be neutered in the down-and-away part of the strike zone. Barring the shortening up of Thomas' swing, what were average college contact rates will likely translate to below-average rates in pro ball, but he might grow into enough power for that to be alright. At Texas, Thomas played center field, left field, and first base. His reads in the outfield aren't very good and unless they improve, his arm forces him to left. Thomas only has the two years of college experience, so it's worth a shot to continue things in center for at least a little while, and the Rockies played him in left and center during his brief pro debut. Thomas' realistic ceiling is as a power-over-hit 1B/LF platoon bat, and he requires a little more projection than is typical of a college hitter."
John Peck,SS,DET,2028,,40,Med,22.7,35,40,45,45,"Peck had a bit of a down junior year at Pepperdine but looked great at the Draft Combine and, despite his flaws, he's shaping up to be a pretty slick seventh round pick. He has uncommon power for a shortstop, a position where Peck projects to stay thanks to his terrific hands and body control. Peck's swing looks exactly like that of Brewers prospect Eric Brown, with his hands starting way over his head before they load deep behind him. Peck is a bit of a bucket strider but still tends to spray contact to the opposite field, especially against fastballs. He has the strength to do damage that way, but his bat path is also vulnerable to whiffing against lots of elevated fastballs as a result of how deep his load tends to be. Peck was among the Tigers' org leaders in hard-hit rate last year at a whopping 51%, but his strikeouts exploded after he was promoted to West Michigan. He's more likely to be a power-over-hit utility type than an everyday shortstop."
Lisbel Diaz,RF,SFG,2029,,35+,High,19.7,40,45,45,50,"Diaz is a fairly projectable 19-year-old outfielder with good spreadsheet stats — 13% swinging strike rate, 84% in-zone contact, 74% overall, 109 mph max exit velo — for a hitter his age. He raked his way from the Arizona complex to the Cal League in the second half of 2024 and held his own, with a 103 wRC+ across 55 games at San Jose. The combination of Diaz's tendency to chase and his bat path (which I think will leave him very vulnerable to soft stuff in the bottom of the zone) is what's stopping him from ranking higher on this list, as I fear a strikeout uptick looms. But for a relatively projectable 6-foot-2, he's on time to pull fairly often and he has a great arm. There's enough to like here to consider Diaz a prospect, but aspects of his swing and underlying chase data serve as a warning not to take his other stats at face value."
Robert Moore,SS,PHI,2027,,35+,Low,23,40,45,34,60,"Moore has been a known prospect since his underclass high school days, and he ended up matriculating to Arkansas early in order to be an extremely young (20.3) junior for his draft year. There was a stretch where he looked like a future first rounder, but Moore had a downtick in performance as a junior and there was a rumor at the time that he might go back to school to try to recoup some draft helium with an age-21 senior season. Instead, Moore signed with the Brewers for $800,000 as a second rounder. After two seasons in Milwaukee's system, Moore was traded to the Phillies for Oliver Dunn. In 2024, he posted a .240/.323/.364 line at Reading, a fairly accurate representation of his talent as a hitter. The tiny Moore struggles to hit for power and has some plate coverage issues from the left side, often failing to contact pitches on the outer third. Plus actions and advanced defensive acumen are now his carrying tools, enabling him to project as a viable defender at both middle infield positions and a low-impact utilityman overall."
Angel Bastardo,SP,TOR,2025,,40+,Med,22.8,,,,,"Bastardo had Tommy John in late June and will go on the 60-day IL immediately. It’s possible he won’t return early enough in 2025 to satisfy the requirement that he be active for at least 90 days for Toronto to keep him; that might have to wait until 2026. The Red Sox had developed Bastardo as a starter for his entire career but due to his fastball’s surprising lack of playability and his below-average control, he has been projected as a reliever here at FanGraphs. Bastardo’s best pitch is his changeup, an 84-88 mph offering that dies as it approaches the plate as if an invisible parachute has popped out of the back of it. He can manipulate breaking ball shape but doesn’t land his slider regularly, and Bastardo’s arm angle is the sort that imparts hittable shape and angle on his fastball. He should be able to reach back for more heat in a one-inning role and bully hitters with even more velocity. His injury adds risk and delays his debut, but Bastardo has arguably the most upside of any Rule 5 pick as a late-inning reliever."
Zac Leigh,SIRP,CHC,2025,,40,High,27.4,,,,,"Leigh finally crossed the 40-inning threshold in 2024, and though his velocity was way, way down early in the year, by September it had rebounded into the 93-97 mph range. Leigh has an explosive drop-and-drive delivery and whippy arm action that produces a naturally cutting fastball. An upper-70s power curve tunnels well off his heater, and Leigh has a distinct 81-85 mph slider too. He looks like a pretty standard middle reliever and should debut in 2025 if he can stay healthy."
Caden Grice,SP,ARI,2026,,40,High,22.8,,,,,"Grice was an effective two-way player at Clemson and hit .288/.398/.560 during his career there, but when the Diamondbacks drafted him, he was announced exclusively as a pitcher. He struck out 101 hitters in 78 innings as a junior, mostly because of his secondary pitch quality. Grice had a great first month at Visalia in 2024, but then became walk-prone in May and June, and he was shut down with injury and had a Tommy John surgery. The timing of the surgery means that Grice will, at the earliest, return for late- and post-season activity in 2025. 
Healthy Grice uses both his upper-70s slider and mid-80s changeup to miss bats. His slider is especially nasty, bending in with tight two-plane movement. At times, he shows obvious arm deceleration on his changeup, which might impact its performance against more experienced hitters who can spot it on release. Grice has a big, prototypical pitcher's frame at a broad-shouldered 6-foot-6, his delivery is easy looking and consistent, and we like to round up on two-way guys like this who have barely had time to focus solely on their current position. Even with a 90-91 mph fastball, Grice was tracking like a high-probability backend starter. His grade stays the same here, but his ranking has been adjusted to account for the multi-season pause caused by the timing of the TJ."
Jared Johnson,SIRP,ATH,2025,,40,High,24,,,,,"Acquired in exchange for Nick Allen, Johnson is a very physical, high-effort relief prospect who utilizes a slider-heavy approach to pitching. Johnson's slider will bend in as hard as 94 mph. He hides the ball well and throws with such violence that it often takes hitters a second to adjust to his delivery. His fastball will touch 99, but Johnson's very high release point creates a downhill angle that hurts the pitch's ability to miss bats. Johnson's stuff is pretty nasty, and while his bull-in-a-china-shop control will probably limit him to up/down duty when he debuts, he could pitch his way into a more regular middle relief role if he gains better control of his body in his mid-20s."
Najer Victor,SIRP,LAA,2026,,40,High,23.3,,,,,"A native of the U.S. Virgin Islands, Victor began his college career in Fort Myers at Florida Gulf Coast before transferring to UCF for his junior and senior seasons. A pure reliever, Victor surrendered 15 earned runs in his 24.1 senior innings and fell to the third day of the draft, where he signed for $150,000 (so $25,000 against the Angels' bonus pool). He was impressive after the draft and lit scouts up at instructs, where he sat 95-98 with a plus slider. Victor likely won't have the command to work in high-leverage situations, but he looks like a quick-moving middle reliever."
Sabier Marte,SP,NYY,2028,,40,High,21.1,,,,,"Marte is a walking construction crane at a high-waisted 6-foot-5, and he has uncommon control for a college-aged pitcher, let alone one his size. He led the Yankees' complex roster in innings in 2024 with 49 and only walked 16 guys. 
Marte is still more about polish and projection than present stuff. He locates his slider consistently enough for it to have produced plus miss and chase rates in 2024 despite lacking bat-missing depth, though Marte's size and the downhill nature of all his pitches helps create an artificial depth of sorts. He also has good changeup feel and throws plenty of strikes with his fastball, but Marte still has below-average velocity and his heater plays down some due to the same downhill plane that aids his slider. 
It's important for Marte to develop more velocity if he's going to be an impact starter, as his current stuff is more akin to that of a grounder-getting backend innings-eater. To that end, juxtaposed against Marte's exciting size and frame is his vanilla athleticism; his delivery is more about ease and consistency than explosion. I still think the fastball has helium, just not as much as I did a year ago. Marte's big league ETA is probably three more seasons away. He's a pretty good bet to be added to the Yankees' 40-man roster after the 2026 season, assuming he adds about 20 annual innings to his ledger without losing any velocity."
Owen Wild,SP,TBR,2027,,40,Med,22.7,,,,,"Wild has had a three-tick velocity spike since college and is now sitting 92 with plus-plus vertical life. He commands his slider much better than his heater, which is fine considering fastballs that ride like Wild's have a lot of in-zone margin for error and miss bats even when they're mislocated. This helped Wild keep his walk rate down in a first full pro season — 121.1 IP, 11.20 K/9, 2.30 BB/9, 2.82 ERA — during which he was quickly promoted to High-A. Wild's slider tends to finish on the plate and live more off hitters' surprise that it isn't his fastball rather than its own nastiness. He might benefit from a second breaking ball, be it a cutter or a curveball, the latter of which feels logical to pair with his rising heater. If Wild's changeup can develop (it flashes bat-missing sink every once in a while, but sails on him way more), then he'll be able to pitch in a good rotation despite having 40-grade velo."
Royber Salinas,MIRP,ATL,2026,,40,High,24,,,,,"Salinas' bus quite literally broke down on the shoulder in 2024, as Royber needed surgery on his last July and isn't expected to be back until toward the end of 2025. The Braves traded Salinas to Oakland as part of the Sean Murphy deal in 2022, and for a minute, he looked like a potential mid-rotation starter. In 2024, his mechanics broke down and so did his arm. He was shut down in the middle of the season and attempted to rest his shoulder to avoid surgery, but it didn't work. The A's DFA'd him and the Braves claimed him off waivers, then they non-tendered him and brought him back on a minor league deal. 
Healthy Salinas sits about 95 and will mix in different shapes. He has a plus mid-80s slider and was searching for a third pitch, which has been either a cutter or curveball depending on when you caught him. His fastball was down two-and-a-half ticks last year before he was shut down. Salinas isn't the best-conditioned athlete, but his hips are loose, and I bought that he could work a starter's load of innings at the time of the trade. Now we wait for Salinas to get right physically, and see where he's at when he returns. He's got a shot to play a meaningful bullpen role in 2026."
Bradley Blalock,MIRP,COL,2025,,40,Med,24.3,,,,,"Blalock was selected as a safety pick in the 32nd round of the 2019 draft under the assumption that he was heading to school, but when the ink was dry everywhere else, Boston still had enough bonus pool money left to sign him for $250,000. He had an inconsistent full-season debut in 2021, but also showed significant growth in terms of velocity, sitting 93-95 mph. He entered 2022 as a potential breakout guy, but injuries (TJ and an oblique injury) have impacted large portions of Blalock's last few seasons and his stuff has been more average of late. During that span, he was traded from Boston to Milwaukee (for Luis Urías) and then to Colorado as part of the Nick Mears deal. 
Blalock made his big league debut in 2024 with six starts, most of which came toward the end of the year. His position on the rubber changed a couple times throughout the season, including in his final big league outing. It seems like there's still tinkering happening here. Blalock has a due north arm slot and vertical fastball/breaking ball attack. He has four decent pitches and should be a fine spot starter while he has options left, and then transition to a long relief role when he's out of them."
Roberto Campos,RF,DET,2027,,40,High,21.8,45,45,50,50,"Campos, who signed for $3 million in 2019, is a physical corner outfield prospect with roughly average pull power. He repeated High-A last season and his performance took a substantial leap, from a 98 wRC+ in 2023 to a 120 in 2024. He is so geared to pull that he often swings inside sliders and over the top of changeups, but Campos is a dangerous fastball hitter who looks like a big leaguer in the uniform. His underlying contact data (72% contact rate, 38% hard-hit rate) is in line with the big league average, and it's feasible Campos could play the short side of a corner platoon at maturity."
Connor Thomas,MIRP,MIL,2025,,35+,Low,26.8,,,,,"There was a point when Thomas looked like a lock to be a backend starter, but he pitched out of Memphis’ bullpen in 2024, sometimes covering multiple innings at a time. He worked 90.1 total innings in 56 appearances. Thomas throws both a sinker and four-seamer that sit between 88-91 mph. Neither has plus movement or life, so Thomas fully depends on his impressive command to stop them from getting hammered. His plus-spinning slider, his most-used offering, has above-average length and two-plane shape in the 80-84 mph range. Thomas has robotically consistent command of it and uses it to get looking strikes and as a chase pitch. His cutter also has sharp action and crowds the hands of righty batters. He also throws his changeup to righties but too often that pitch either cuts or sails on Thomas. He has the look of a high-floored sixth to eighth starter but appears slated to play a bulk relief role in his first season with Milwaukee if indeed Thomas sticks."
Angel Guzman,LF,SFG,2028,,35+,Med,19.4,50,50,50,50,"Guzman was in Arizona for extended spring training but went back to the DSL for the summer, where he had an exceptional season in his second tour of duty. He slashed .305/.475/.523 and posted a tremendous combination of contact (85%) and hard-hit (42%) rates. Guzman indeed has an exciting present contact and power blend, but he isn't especially projectable. In terms of build and body comps, we're talking about Robbie Grossman or Gerardo Parra. Guzman's top-hand driven swing covers a lot of the plate and his overall package is seasoned with a pretty good idea of the strike zone. He'll have to hit all the way up the ladder as a likely left fielder, but Guzman is off to a good start."
Erick Brito,SS,PHI,2026,,35+,Med,22.8,55,60,30,50,"Brito is a gamer/grinder infielder with pesky bat-to-ball ability, the sort who tends to be on the 40-man fringe. He's a compact athlete with a very short swing that makes him tough to beat in the strike zone, but what little power Brito has ends up being undercut by his approach, which prioritizes early-count contact. Though he doesn't have ideal shortstop arm strength, Brito's effort level and instincts allow him to make some difficult plays. He's fair at shortstop and above-average at second base. In the Yonny Hernández mold, Brito should play an up/down utility infield role."
Jacob Steinmetz,SP,ARI,2026,,40,High,21.7,,,,,"Steinmetz took a big step forward in 2024. He worked over 100 innings for the first time in his career, his walk rate improved by a huge margin, and his delivery looks more effortless and graceful than ever before. Steinmetz uses a curveball/slider combo right now, but some of his sliders are 87-89 and he might have a sweeper/cutter combination eventually. His curveball has always had good natural depth, but it can be easy to identify out of the hand. Steinmetz has an innings-eater's build and, increasingly, an innings-eater's delivery and control. His stuff isn't monstrous, but it's good enough for him to work at the back of a rotation if he takes another step forward in terms of workload and strike-throwing."
Chalniel Arias,SP,NYY,2028,,40,High,21.6,,,,,"For the last couple of years, the Yankees' rookie affiliates have been full of enormous pitching prospects who make it look like the club is trying to start a basketball team. The broad-shouldered, 6-foot-4-ish Arias is among them. He was promoted from the DSL to the FCL near the end of the 2023 season after he struck out 35 hitters in his first five DSL starts, often working five or six innings at a time, much more than is typical for a rookie ball pitcher. Arias began the 2024 season on the IL with shoulder inflammation, was activated in July, and then made just three regular season appearances. His stuff was up across the board during that window, but it's impossible to tell whether or not Arias will be able to sustain it across an entire season. His downhill fastball averaged 95 mph, up two ticks from 2023, and his slider experienced an even bigger uptick, morphing from an upper-70s offering into one that lived in the 83-87 mph range. His firm, 90-ish mph changeup is still Arias' most-used secondary, and automatic pitch tagging often mistakes it for a sinker. You can dream on Arias' fastball velocity and changeup quality because of his spindly build, relative youth, and the overall fluidity of his mechanics, but he enters 2025 as a very volatile prospect due to his lack of innings."
Gregory Barrios,SS,TBR,2027,,40,Med,21,55,60,30,60,"Barrios was acquired from the Brewers in exchange for Aaron Civale a few weeks before the 2024 trade deadline. He was hitting well at High-A Wisconsin prior to the trade and then went ice cold after it, slashing a combined .288/.342/.367 on the year. Barrios is a twitchy little shortstop who plays a fun and effective style of defense. His first step is incredible, and he has plus range, acrobatic actions, and a surprisingly strong arm for a little guy. He's a very skinny young fellow who projects to play a glove-first utility role in the big leagues. 
There are times when it looks like Barrios is a child swinging a tree branch, but he still finds a way to put the bat on the baseball. He had a 11.7% K% and 83% contact rate on the year, but a lot of that contact was light, oppo spray. Can we project on Barrio's strength? He's only 20 and his measurables for a player that age are average, but he's so thin and frail looking right now that he might be in the ""Carlos Tocci Zone,"" the sort of athlete who struggles to add mass at all. Barrios' excellent defense still gives him a great chance to have a prolonged big league career in the mold of Rey Sanchez and Jack Wilson."
Carlos D. Rodriguez,CF,ATL,2025,,40,Med,24.3,60,60,30,50,"Rodriguez spent the early portion of his career in the Brewers system, projecting as a slash-and-dash fifth outfielder with great bat-to-ball ability and basically no power or plate discipline. In 2024, his last year in Milwaukee's system before electing free agency and joining the Braves on a non-guaranteed big league deal (he was put on the 40-man), C-Rod slashed .284/.368/.374 split between Double- and Triple-A, then played winter ball in Venezuela. To repackage a joke from last year's write-up, Rodriguez's offensive profile is like a serial killer speed dating: lots of slashing, singles only. His 25 extra-base hits in 2024 tied his career high. He can occasionally turn on a down-and-in pitch, but he's generally geared to spray oppo line drives over the head of the shortstop. He is very difficult to make swing-and-miss; Rodriguez ran an 11.8% strikeout rate, a 93% in-zone contact and a 89% overall contact rate in 2024. Two aspects of Rodriguez's game have been in flux for the last year: His speed has dipped a bit as he's filled out, but his selectivity at the plate has improved to roughly average. He still looked fine in center field during winter ball play in Venezuela, and he should provide the Braves with a viable bench outfielder's skill set."
Franco Aleman,SIRP,CLE,2025,,40,Med,24.8,,,,,"Aleman has altered his approach to pitching since leaving Florida (he was at St. John's River and Florida International prior to UF) and is now much more apt to take advantage of the way his fastball plays at the top of the zone. He's also added a couple ticks of velo, averaging 95.7 mph on his fastball the last two years. The size of an NBA wing player at a long-levered 6-foot-6, Aleman also releases the baseball seemingly right on top of hitters. His low-ish slot wreaks havoc on righties' ability to pick up the baseball out of his hand and makes it tough for them to spot his slider. Aleman is a pretty standard fastball/slider middle reliever likely to see big league time either late in 2025 or early in 2026."
Sean Sullivan,MIRP,COL,2026,,40,Low,22.7,,,,,"Sullivan is an ultra-deceptive cross-bodied lefty with 20-grade velocity. He's done well in the mid-minors despite sitting 87 mph because of a mix of deception, command, and quality secondary stuff. Sullivan's stride direction takes him toward the first base line at an extreme angle, and this, in concert with his low three-quarters slot, takes hitters a few looks to get comfortable with. Sullivan's fastball averaged 90 mph in 2023 and 87 mph in 2024, but he still managed a 2.11 ERA, 125 strikeouts and just 15 walks across 115.1 innings, good for a microscopic 3.4% walk rate. In college, Sullivan's repertoire was fastball-heavy in the extreme at about 75% usage. His usage is still really high (67% in 2024), but he's been branching out in pro ball and his changeup generated huge rates of chase and miss last year. His slider plays by virtue of Sullivan's odd release. It's fair to be skeptical that this will actually work in a starting pitcher capacity — asking a guy who sits 87 to navigate a big league lineup three times feels like too much — but in short relief bursts where hitters have no time to adjust to Sullivan's funk, he should be fine."
RJ Petit,SIRP,DET,2025,,40,Med,25.5,,,,,"Try as he might to hide behind a thematically ill-fitting name, short stride and low-three-quarters arm slot, Petit is undeniably enormous. The size gives his running fastball a downhill angle, sapping it of any above-average bat-missing quality despite its mid-to-upper-90s velocity. The shorter stride on a big body can set up Petit’s arm to be late, as he posted a career-worst 11.1% walk rate in 58.2 IP at Double-A last year. But while it’s not a precise operation, Petit has a clear feel for which quadrants to dump his slider and changeup into, and he gets substantial chase on the former.
Petit struck out 31.1% of Double-A hitters with this mix, so it’s getting pretty easy to foresee a good stretch of command carrying him to Detroit. Greater precision and feel with the changeup seems like the best path for graduating to some medium-leverage work when he gets there."
Cristian Hernandez,SS,CHC,2028,,35+,High,21.3,30,20,40,55,"The former $3 million signee repeated Low-A in 2024 and turned in a career year, slashing .269/.382/.406 with 37 extra-base hits and 44 stolen bases in 52 attempts on the season. Most importantly, Hernandez cut his strikeout rate quite a bit compared to his 2022-23 peak, which was up around 30%; he had a 19% rate after a mid-August promotion to South Bend. Hernandez's swing is still really long. It's whippy and powerful, but Hernandez's feet are all over the place and it's tough for him to time his whole operation. It's going to be a big enough issue to prevent Hernandez from being an everyday shortstop, even though he otherwise has the tools to be. Hernandez is an excellent defender capable of highlight reel plays and throws from deep in the hole, he's physically projectable, and he has big bat speed, but at age 21, he's still a very raw hitter."
Colton Gordon,SP,HOU,2025,,35+,Low,26.3,,,,,"Gordon kicked back from Florida to Hillsborough Community College (FL) before bumping back to Division-I ball with Central Florida. He made four starts there before the 2020 shutdown, then his 2021 season for the Knights was cut short by Tommy John. The Astros used a 2021 Day Two pick on him anyway and hustled Gordon up the minor league ladder when he was finally back from his TJ rehab in 2022. He was assigned straight to Double-A Corpus Christi in 2023 and Triple-A Sugar Land in 2024, where he K'd a batter per inning and worked just over 120 innings for the second straight year. While his smoke-and-mirrors deception hasn't played quite as well as it did against A-ball bats, Gordon is still throwing a starter's level of strikes and showing stuff commensurate with a backend starter. Gordon’s four-seam fastball sits between 90-92 mph, but it consistently plays above its pure velocity due to his top-tier extension. His cross-bodied delivery makes him especially tough against lefties. He throws two breaking balls. His curveball is a 1-to-7 shaped offering that often morphs into a slurvey-shaped pitch, while his slider is a shorter sweeper type that shows sharper break. The effectiveness of Gordon’s changeup is driven by his ability to throw the pitch with deceptive arm speed; on pure stuff, it's lacking. Gordon squeezes the most out of his arsenal via deception and unpredictability, and projects to be a spot starter relatively soon."
Marques Johnson,SIRP,SFG,2026,,35+,High,24.7,,,,,"A swingman who finished his career at Long Beach State with some great starts, the Red Sox deployed Johnson solely as a reliever when he turned pro, and he experienced a velo uptick before he was traded to the Giants for Mauricio Llovera. An elbow fracture shelved him for much of 2024, but when he was healthy, Johnson looked the same as he had before surgery. He sits 93-95 with flat angle and cut, and off of that bends in a plus-flashing mid-80s slider with inconsistent shape. So long as he can throw enough strikes, Johnson should be a low-leverage reliever."
Gunnar Hoglund,SP,ATH,2025,,35+,Med,25.3,,,,,"Hoglund threw 130.2 frames between Double- and Triple-A in 2024, posting a 3.58 ERA on the season while striking out 23% of batters and walking just 7%. A former first round draft pick, Hoglund came to Oakland as part of the Matt Chapman trade. He was an east/west fastball/slider guy at Ole Miss, but he's adopted more of a vertical attack since returning from Tommy John. In general, Hoglund has to pitch around his fastball due to its below-average velocity and movement, and he tries to land his slider at the top of the zone for strikes. He has above-average command (not plus — his above-the-zone operation with his fastball makes it tough for Hoglund to work very efficiently), and he does a good job of staying out of the heart of the plate with his heater. The slider remains the headliner of his arsenal, and it has solid spin and two-plane shape, which is especially effective against right-handed hitters. His changeup will also flash average with plenty of depth. Hoglund looks like a strike-throwing depth starter and/or bulk reliever."
Hayden Alvarez,CF,LAA,2031,,35+,High,18,45,45,40,60,"The toolsiest member of the Angels' DSL team, Alvarez is built like a college wide receiver at a ripped 6-foot-3. He's a plus runner with burgeoning raw power that hasn't manifested in games yet due to Alvarez's wonky swing, which isn't in the zone for very long. His early-career chase and contact performance creates an exciting offensive foundation for an up-the-middle prospect whose career is just getting started."
Juan Villavicencio,SS,PHI,2028,,35+,High,20.3,45,45,40,55,"Villavicencio is a punchy little infielder with good power for a hitter his size and enough arm for shortstop. He has experience at several positions already and should be a versatile utilityman down the line. Though he has pretty good power for his age and size, Villavicencio isn't all that projectable and will probably max out with below-average hit and power tools. That's still enough to fit in a bench role so long as you can actually play shortstop."
Luis Mey,SIRP,CIN,2025,,40+,High,23.8,,,,,"Mey had a 2024 Fall League like Abner Uribe's 2023. The wild, inconsistent reliever with upper-90s gas put everything together for six weeks and dominated, allowing just one hit in eight appearances. Mey will touch 102, and his fastball sometimes has enough hair on it to break the bat of the hitter <em>and</em> the guy in the on deck circle at the same time. His best sliders have unhittable wipeout movement. This is late-inning stuff, but Mey has never been able to control it for any length of time and he's run walk rates in the 15-20% range since entering full season ball. He struggles to repeat his release, as if his body is too explosive for its own good. What the entire industry saw in the Fall League was a setup man type of pitcher. Pitchers like Mey sometimes find command in their mid-20s and pitch at the back of a bullpen, at least for a while. Even when it looks like guys like Uribe, or Camilo Doval, or Josh Staumont (there have been a million guys like this) have figured it out, it can be fleeting and leave them just as soon. Expect some feast and famine stretches from Mey."
Christian Cerda,C,ARI,2026,,40,Low,22.3,40,40,40,30,"Cerda came over from Tampa Bay in the 2022 David Peralta trade and reached Double-A for the first time at the end of 2024. He's a fiery on-field leader who has improved on defense during the last several seasons. When the Diamondbacks first got Cerda, he was a pretty awful receiver and ball-blocker, but he's gotten much better at both over the last couple of years. He has great lateral agility whether he's catching on one knee or from a traditional crouch; Cerda uses the latter with runners on base. Cerda has above-average arm strength and below-average arm accuracy right now. He's on track to have a glove-first backup profile because his best offensive skill is his plate discipline. Though his torso rotates like the head of an owl in the batter's box, Cerda hasn't produced much game power. He hasn't been striking out very much, but he lacks deft barrel accuracy and misses a fair bit in the zone. He might strike out more as he accrues upper level reps and opposing arms realize they don't have to nibble to get Cerda out. Young enough to add a little more strength and power, Cerda is tracking like a solid backup."
Juan Matheus,SS,NYY,2028,,40,Med,20.9,55,60,40,55,"Matheus missed most of 2023 with a broken thumb but was still promoted from the DSL to the Tampa complex group for 2024, hitting .321/.429/.488 en route to a late-season promotion to the Low-A affiliate. That slash line is a caricature of Matheus' talent, as he's more likely to be a good utilityman than an impact player, but he's a skilled switch-hitter and versatile defender, talented enough to be a relevant prospect even though he's years from the bigs. 
Matheus fits the ""short, but not small"" prospect archetype, as he is very physical and strong for a hitter his size. He hasn't seemed to lose any of his mobility as a result of beefing up, and he has the speed and range to continue to develop at shortstop. On offense, Matheus tracks pitches very well and guides the barrel all over the zone. He's especially adept at staying on breaking balls and putting those into play even when they're not in the zone. Despite his size and strength, Matheus isn't producing high-end exit velocities right now, and he's physically maxed out, so it's difficult to project that he'll develop much more power down the line. This is what limits his perceived ceiling and has him graded as a likely future utility type, one still several levels away."
Émilien Pitre,2B,TBR,2027,,40,Low,22.5,55,55,40,50,"Raised in a French-speaking suburb of Montreal, Pitre became the fourth-highest drafted Quebecer (Phillippe Aumont, taken 11th overall in 2007, is the highest) when the Rays took him in the second round in 2024. After riding the bench as a freshman, Pitre hit well for two years at Kentucky, with more walks than strikeouts in both seasons and a .301/.420/.519 line as a junior. Like most of college baseball, Pitre enjoyed a huge power uptick in 2024, hitting 10 of his 11 career homers. 
A compact-stroked, contact-oriented second baseman, Pitre has some pull power on the inner third of the plate, but otherwise tends to work the opposite field. He tracks pitches well and gently guides the barrel around the zone, willing to take what's given a lot of the time. Pitre's swing isn't especially athletic; it's very conservative in its style and might benefit from more lower body movement as a means of unlocking power. 
Pitre is a good second base defender who deserves a pro look at shortstop just to see if he can do it. If it turns out he can, it will be a little less important for him to access more power than he currently seems capable of. As a second base-only fit, he has a second-division ceiling. At shortstop, Pitre could be a Joey Wendle type."
Rolddy Munoz,SIRP,ATL,2025,,40,High,25,,,,,"Munoz has one of the better sliders in the minors and has K'd at least a batter per inning every season that he's been in pro ball, including 32.2% of the Double-A hitters he faced in 2024. His 85-89 mph comet slider often has incredible length for how hard it is. Munoz also has one of the bigger gaps in the minor leagues between his fastball's velocity and its effectiveness. His 98-mph heater plays down due to ineffective movement, below-average control, and because Munoz's delivery appears easy for hitters to time. These issues will probably limit his role to the middle innings."
Jack Mahoney,SP,COL,2026,,40,Med,23.6,,,,,"Mahoney played both ways a little bit as an underclassman at SC. He pitched out of the bullpen during most of his freshman year, then missed 2022 recovering from Tommy John, though he was still able to hit some that year. He held 92-94 and touched 96-97 across 17 starts as a junior, and Mahoney was thrown right into the fire from an innings standpoint in 2024, as he worked 120 frames and ended his season in Spokane. It was a very positive campaign for Mahoney even though the Cal League was probably beneath his skill level — he held average velocity all year and walked just 30 guys. His fastball tails, he commands a short, mid-80s slider sitting 84-86 mph, and he has arm-side changeup feel. Mahoney's feel for location is advanced considering his lack of college reps and he has a shot to develop three average pitches. There's a backend starter projection here, with a non-zero chance he's scratching the surface of more."
Michael Massey,SIRP,DET,2026,,40,Med,22,,,,,"Massey spent his freshman season at Tulane before transferring to Wake. He spent his sophomore season in the Demon Deacons' bullpen and was utterly dominant — 76 K, 41.2 innings — in a long relief role. Massey moved into their rotation in 2024 and struggled with walks. Hamstring and back issues shelved him for about a month, and he was put back into the bullpen upon his return. His stuff is still exciting. Massey has a cut/carry fastball up to 96, he added a vertical curveball in 2024 with plus depth in the 77-80 mph range, and his 81-84 mph slider has short glove-side break. Massey could conceivably be developed as a starter in pro ball, but his body and level of mechanical consistency are more typical fits in the bullpen. Here he's projected as a solid middle reliever."
Fernando Cruz,SS,CHC,2030,,35+,High,18.4,40,40,45,60,"Cruz shined in a showcase setting as an amateur and was one of the first top bonus prospects from the 2024 class to be generally known throughout the scouting industry. He signed for $4 million in January 2024 and had a pretty rough DSL debut. He ran a sub-70% contact rate on the year and K'd 27.2% of the time, slashing .215/.326/.329. There's still a great defensive foundation here. Cruz has gorgeous infield footwork and actions, turning the baseball around in the blink of an eye. He can make strong, accurate throws from all kinds of platforms and could eventually be a special defensive player. His swing can be a little noisy and long, something that has plagued a few of Chicago's high-bonus shortstop prospects. Until Cruz shows contact improvement, he slots behind the other, similarly flawed players in the org who are ahead of him on the minor league ladder."
Jacob Bresnahan,SIRP,SFG,2028,,35+,Med,19.8,,,,,"Bresnahan was an over-slot 13th rounder in 2023 who took $375,000 rather than go to Oregon. He was acquired at the 2024 trade deadline for Alex Cobb. Bresnahan has issues with breaking ball quality and command, and he doesn't throw especially hard right now, but his size, arm action, and the power of his lower body are traits that indicate he's going to have an impact fastball at maturity, especially if/when he's moved to the bullpen; this projection assumes a velo spike accompanying an eventual shift to relief. None of Bresnahan's secondary pitches are good right now. His changeup feels like it has the best shot to improve, thanks mostly to the explosive quality of Bresnahan's arm action. Allowing Bresnahan to develop as a starter in the mid-minors will give both his slider and changeup more opportunities to develop via reps. Until either his velocity or one of his secondary pitch takes a step forward, he'll exist in this FV range, which includes developmental sleepers."
Colby Thomas,LF,ATH,2025,,35+,Med,24.2,30,30,50,50,"Thomas is a physical little outfielder who takes bloodthirsty, max-effort, pull-side hacks that come at the expense of his ability to make contact. He had a huge 2024 first half at Double-A and only K'd at an 18% clip, but after his promotion to Las Vegas, Thomas' strikeouts jumped back up to his career-usual rate around 30%. He still managed to hit 31 homers across the entire season. His corner outfield-only defensive profile continues to hinder the likelihood he'll ever be a mainstay on a 26-man roster, but his power-oriented offensive profile looks like it will have up/down value."
Trey Gregory-Alford,SIRP,LAA,2029,,35+,High,20.9,,,,,"The most recent mid-draft, over-slot high school pitcher selected by the Angels, TGA was a fixture on the high school showcase circuit. Between the summer of 2023 and the 2024 Draft Combine, he added nearly 10 ticks to his fastball, which touched 100 at the Combine. A big-framed, physically mature righty with below-average control, Gregory-Alford's fastball was mostly sitting 91-94 when he was pitching with Team USA in the fall of 2023. Though it required a ton of effort, he was throwing much harder the following spring and he was working in the 94-97 mph range during 2024 instructs. TGA also has a vertical, mid-80s slider that looks like a potential finishing pitch. He's not a premium athlete and he's physically maxed out, both traits of a relief prospect. This grade awaits TGA showing that he can maintain plus velocity across a whole pro season before he climbs into a FV tier with the other upside relievers."
Juan Amarante,SIRP,PHI,2027,,35+,Low,21,,,,,"Amarante originally signed with the Pirates but never threw a pitch for their org; about six months later, he was cut loose and signed with Philly. He spent two years in the DSL and the first chunk of 2024 with the complex affiliate before a late-July promotion to Low-A. Amarante commands a really great two-plane curveball, which should spearhead a lefty specialist future for him, especially if he sees a velo boost out of the bullpen."
Brady Smith,SP,LAD,2028,,40+,Med,20.2,,,,,"Smith was a favorite of mine from the 2023 Draft Combine, an athletic-but-somewhat undersized righty with plus fastball ride and advanced secondary pitches. The Dodgers got a deal done with him for $700,000, and Smith had Tommy John during the 2023-24 offseason. This is the kind of pitcher who clicks if the rehab process led to strength gains and added velocity, because so much of the rest of a starter's pitch mix is already on board. Smith creates plus depth on a curveball and fair tailing action on a changeup, the latter of which has big projection because of his arm speed. He might add a second breaking ball in short order, probably a slider or cutter, and whatever it is might be good immediately because of Smith's ability to spin the ball. He hasn't thrown a pro pitch yet but is a 2025 breakout candidate."
Cristofer Torin,2B,ARI,2027,,40,Low,19.8,60,70,30,40,"Torin is a bat control savant with limited power and defensive ability. He's posted in-zone contact rates in the 88-91% range so far as a pro, but the quality of his contact is often light, and he slashed .255/.381/.344 at Low-A Visalia in 2024. Torin uses very simple, conservative footwork and lets his hand-eye coordination and bat control do the work for his offense. He hits a lot of choppers and grounders and makes a ton of soft contact, posting one of the three lowest hard-hit rates among D-backs full-season hitters the last two years. He gives you glimpses of exciting rotational ability, especially when Torin has to tuck his hands in and barrel stuff in around his naval. But in general, this is a singles hitter and a smaller guy without the overt physical projection that would indicate he'll eventually have real power. 
Torin has also plateaued as a defender. He has a quick exchange and a lovely arm stroke, but his agility, range and hands are all below average for a shortstop. He's playing a mix of both middle infield spots right now, but projects to second base for us. 
The bat-to-ball skill here is pretty special and Torin is very young. We want to leave room for improvement and we value his profile, but barring an unexpected leap in his explosiveness, Torin is likely to produce akin to Luis Urías. He needs to develop either defensive versatility or power to play a more meaningful big league role."
Mani Cedeno,SS,NYY,2031,,40,Med,16.6,50,50,40,50,"Cedeno is a medium-framed shortstop with maybe the best infield hands in the class. His glove is like a frog's tongue, and he has an unbelievably quick exchange. His range, footwork, arm strength, and overall athleticism are all closer to average. Cedeno has some pull power on middle-in mistakes, but is otherwise more vanilla in terms of his bat speed and physical projection. He signed for $2.5 million in January, but realistically, he's utility fit without an obviously high ceiling."
Kameron Misner,CF,TBR,2025,,40,High,27.2,30,40,50,55,"Five years removed from his draft night, Misner still touts the premium size and athleticism commensurate with his $2.1 million signing bonus out of Missouri. With the plus foot speed to run down some gappers, he’s fine part-time in center field, though he would provide more defensive value in a full-time corner outfield role. But full-time work will likely prove to be elusive, as Misner has a long and involved hand load that drives a disqualifying amount of in-zone miss; he threatened a 30% strikeout rate in his second full year at Triple-A Durham. For a would-be specialist, Misner lived in contradiction in 2024. His swing is generally defanged by plus velocity, but his only hit in a 1-for-15, 10-strikeout big league cameo was a single off a 101-mph Mason Miller heater. He’s been getting plus raw power grades for the last decade, but Misner didn’t hit a ball 110 mph in a game last season even while putting together a 111 wRC+ at Durham. A lefty reserve outfielder who can moonlight at all three spots and club mistakes can be a folk hero in the right situation, but Misner’s long swing mandates perfect timing in more ways than one."
Jhancarlos  Lara,SIRP,ATL,2027,,40,High,22.2,,,,,"Lara is an exciting but messy 22-year-old power-armed righty with plus-plus arm strength and 30-grade control. He is probably going to be a reliever, not only because he has scattershot command (he walked 16.2% of opposing hitters in 2024), but also because his fastball's shape and plane make it less effective than its velocity might indicate. Lara is built like a college quarterback at a strapping, high-waisted 6-foot-3. He is a powerful, tightly wound athlete whose feel for release is way, way behind his pure arm speed. Often, Lara's delivery isn't well-connected and he throws a ton of non-competitive fastballs, though that's partly because his heater really only plays when it's way up above the zone. He'll reach back for 99-100 on occasion, but his velocity seemed to taper late in 2024 as he was promoted to Double-A for five walk-prone starts. Lara tries to get ahead of hitters with a hard cutter/slider and then elevate his fastball for whiffs. He had low-minors success working with these two pitches in this way, but his development has plateaued. It's possible he'll remain too wild to be a reliable middle reliever. Entering his 40-man platform year, there's a chance the Braves make the pragmatic decision to put Lara in the bullpen. If they do, the ceiling on his velocity is huge, but hopefully there is progress made in other areas that will facilitate Lara's addition to the roster after the season."
Julio Carreras,SS,COL,2025,,40,Low,25.2,30,30,30,60,"Carreras' excellent defense should carry him to a low-impact utility role. He has fantastic defensive footwork, his hands, actions, and transfer are all lightning quick, he has a flair for making acrobatic plays around the second base bag, and his arm (if a little inaccurate at times) is very strong. As he enters his age-25 season, Carreras remains rather thin and has plateaued with gap doubles power, which he struggles to get to because he tends to chase. It's the skill set of a glove-only nine-hole hitter. On a good roster, Carreras would be used as a defensive replacement."
Eli Lovich,RF,CHC,2030,,35+,High,19.7,45,45,55,40,"Lovich got $650,000 in the 11th round out rather than go to Arkansas. He's a thin, wiry left-handed bat with enormous projection. He wasn't overwhelmed by Instructional League arms, he tracks pitches well, his swing is fairly short for a hitter his size (though he's still apt to go oppo), and he might end up with plus or better raw power at maturity. Lovich's size will relegate him to a corner, but he pitched in high school and has the arm for right (and will probably have more at peak). Lovich really needs to hit because of his corner defensive fit, but his foundation as a hitter is strong enough to put him on the prospect radar based on his intructs look."
Brayan Narvaez,SP,SFG,2029,,35+,High,20.4,,,,,"Narvaez is a fairly projectable 20-year-old pitcher whose fastball often had 20 inches of vertical movement in the 2024 DSL. If he can throw harder as he matures, that pitch will be plus. Narvaez throws with a good bit of effort, but his arm action is really whippy and explosive. He's a good athlete and is likely to get stronger. If a velo bump also applies to his shapely upper-70s breaking ball, he's going to have a nasty two-pitch foundation. He was among the org's most exciting DSL pitchers in 2024."
Henry Bolte,RF,ATH,2028,,35+,High,21.7,30,30,40,80,"Bolte is a super toolsy prospect with very intense, profile-altering strikeout issues. He's struck out at least a third of the time at each minor league stop (usually more), but at some of them has still found a way to hit for big power. Bolte is a flat out 80-grade runner with plus raw power and room for more strength on his frame. His swing isn't especially functional and often leaves him inside-outing the baseball the other way. He is likely to strike out at a roughly 40% clip against big league pitching as his swing is currently constituted. 
But Bolte's physical prowess is so impressive that when he reaches his physical prime in five years or so, he might be toolsy enough to have a window of meaningful big league impact despite his flaws. He's someone to watch over a very long period of time, a player who isn't likely to break out until he's on his second org via six year minor league free agency. It will be important for his feel for outfield defense to improve during that time as, despite Bolte's speed, his feel and instincts out there aren't great."
Anyelo Marquez,2B,LAA,2030,,35+,Med,19.3,55,55,40,40,"Marquez was maybe the DSL Angels' most physically and offensively advanced player, as he slashed .294/.420/.395 with more walks than strikeouts and came to the U.S. for instructs in the fall. Marquez has a relatively mature, rectangular build, and is more likely to progress physically with the right strength and conditioning program rather than just via maturation. He has a line drive-oriented swing and plus barrel control, but he'll probably need to add both raw and game power to his skill set to profile at second or third base, the two infields positions he's most likely to be capable of playing."
Dylan Campbell,RF,PHI,2026,,35+,Low,22.7,50,55,45,50,"Campbell was a high school infielder who ended up settling into right field during his college career at Texas, where he had a little bit of a power breakout as a junior. He slashed .251/.331/.372 in the chilly Midwest League in 2024 and stole 42 bases in 49 attempts. The compact Campbell has a minimalistic set-up and swing, with basically no stride and a very short load. He's a dangerous gap-to-gap hitter with this simple operation, and it looks as though he's using a two-strike approach the whole time, expertly guiding the bat head around the bottom of the zone. Campbell does have trouble with up-and-away fastballs at times, and right field is a tough profile when you don't have a plus offensive tool. Campbell is a damn good right fielder and has played some center field but, despite his stolen base totals, he isn't a true burner like is usually required in center. Perhaps there will be more thorough revisitation of second base now that Campbell is a Phillie (the Dodgers traded him for international bonus pool space the week before list publication), which would go a long way to allowing him to play a multi-positional role."
Franyerber Montilla,SS,DET,2028,,35+,High,20,45,45,40,55,"After two years in the DSL, Montilla hit his way off the Lakeland backfields and into Joker Marchant Stadium, as he slashed .273/.409/.448 in the FCL before he was promoted and struggled in 20 FSL games. A very twitchy, undersized infielder, Montilla swings with impressive verve from the left side of the dish but is less coordinated as a right-handed hitter. When you combine his FCL and FSL data, he was more of an average contact hitter (83% in-zone contact, 73% overall) with impressive power for a hitter his size and age (106 mph max exit, 35% hard-hit rate). There's a chance Montilla can develop something close to an average contact and power combination, but his size is perhaps a gating factor for the power aspect, as he's athletic but smaller. He can really button a fastball, especially from the left side, but he struggled with the quality of A-ball secondary stuff upon his promotion, so there's some lurking hit tool risk here, too. Realistically, Montilla has utility infield projection, but he's still among the more talented low-level position player prospects in the Tigers system."
Alberto Barriga,C,ARI,2028,,40,High,20.4,55,60,30,55,"The diminutive Barriga stomped onto the prospect radar during a nutty 2022 Complex League playoff run, but he was limited to just 10 regular season games in 2023 because of a gruesome compound fracture to his femur, which he suffered while simply rounding first base. People in attendance at that game describe the injury as sounding like a bat breaking, and there was worry it might be career-altering. Back with a vengeance in 2024, Barriga was one of the buzzier names on the backfields during extended spring training, as he was again white hot with the bat. It looked like Barriga was going to do everything except hit for power, due to his lack of size. He was snatching pitches at the top of the strike zone, spraying doubles contact all over the place, posting plus run times and pop times to second base, and generally looked twitchier, more athletic, and more advanced than all but a few of his very talented peers. 
Then Barriga's regular season was more solid than spectacular. He slashed .276/.362/.432, which is a pretty average 102 wRC+ in the ACL, then looked overmatched during a brief A-ball trial at the end of the season. His contact metrics (76% contact rate, 86% in the zone) were good but not elite, and his chase rates are a little scary (especially with two strikes) and indicate his contact rates might fall off a bit as he climbs he minors. Because Barriga, who is listed at 5-foot-9 and might be smaller than that, is atypically tiny, we simply won't know whether his little body will be able to withstand the grind of catching across a full season until he actually does it. He only caught 40 games in 2024, so we still don't really know, but he absolutely has the skills to stay back there if his body allows. It's rare for athletes this size to be primary catchers, though, and it's more likely Barriga becomes an Austin Barnes or Garrett Stubbs type of backup."
Yoendrys Gomez,MIRP,NYY,2025,,40,Med,25.5,,,,,"Persistent injuries have kept Gómez from establishing himself as a consistent part of the Yankees' big league pitching staff. He started at Triple-A Scranton all throughout 2024 but was used in long relief during his three brief big league call-ups. Unless the Yankees have been given an extra option year due to Gómez's injury history, he's out of them, and is therefore likely to be moved to the bullpen relatively soon. 
Gómez essentially has a five-pitch mix because of his ability to vary the shape and speed of several different breaking balls. He has a low-80s curveball version to land in the zone, a sweeper that lives in the same velo range, and a harder slider/cutter. His fastball tends to sit 92-94 mph with average rise/run and he was up to 96 last year, both below Gómez's prospect peak of a few years ago, when he was more comfortably in the mid-90s. It's plausible a move to the bullpen will be accompanied by a return to that kind of arm strength. If so, then perhaps there's more ceiling than the low-leverage longman grade Gómez has here."
Will Simpson,1B,TBR,2027,,40,Med,23.6,45,40,50,30,"Simpson spent the majority of 2024 at High-A Lansing but reached Double-A Midland by the end of the year. He was traded to the Rays as part of the Jeffrey Springs deal in late 2024. Simpson is a power-hitting corner infield prospect with strikeout issues due to a grooved swing. Plus bat speed and strength make him a threat from foul pole to foul pole, and he posted an .860 OPS in 2024, but he also struck out in just under 25% of his trips to the plate. Simpson’s bat path has loft and stays in the hitting zone for a long time, but he’s prone to chase (29% in 2024) and he doesn't move the barrel around especially well, which makes it difficult to see a viable path to an average hit tool. Simpson does a good job of producing contact in the air and his ability to carry his above-average raw power over to game action will be vital due to his first base defensive fit. 
Simpson played a dozen games at third base in Lansing but didn't see any time at the hot corner in college or following his promotion to Midland. It will be interesting to see whether he gets more time at third with the Rays because he's capable of making routine plays there, and he would really benefit from being a viable defender at another position besides first. Simpson could be a Patrick Wisdom type player."
Christian Cairo,SS,ATL,2025,,40,Med,23.8,50,55,30,50,"The son of 17-year (wowzers) big league veteran Miguel Cairo, Christian is a skilled shortstop defender who was boxed out of a 40-man spot in Cleveland by the Guardians' mantle-deep group of same-aged shortstops. At age 23, Cairo slashed .240/.354/.326 during a 2024 campaign split between Double-A Akron and Triple-A Columbus. The Braves took Cairo in the Rule 5 Draft because of his defense, and he'll likely compete with Nick Allen for an Opening Day roster spot as the team's glove-first utilityman, which is Cairo's ultimate projection. Though he lacks prototypical shortstop arm strength (and sometimes air mails throws when he's a bit out of range), Cairo is otherwise an elegant and skillful shortstop defender with fantastic footwork and actions, a plus fielder despite his substandard arm. He has below-average bat speed but pretty good feel for moving the barrel around the zone, and Cairo generates soft line drive spray to all fields."
Yeiker Reyes,CF,COL,2028,,40,Low,19.4,55,50,30,60,"Reyes is a skills-over-tools center field prospect with some catalytic qualities and deficient present power. He slashed .266/.392/.328 in the Complex League in 2024. Perhaps Reyes' most impressive skill is his plate discipline, which is steely even with two strikes. He's also a plus runner, plays good center field defense, and bunts well. Though he's of medium build and likely to add a fair bit of strength as he matures, Reyes is currently so lacking in power that it's tough to forecast him  for enough pop to play every day. Instead, he has the skills of a good extra outfielder à la Michael Siani or Myles Straw."
Ty Southisene,SS,CHC,2030,,35+,High,19.7,40,55,35,60,"The Cubs paid Southisene $1,000,000 to bypass his commitment to Tennessee, and while we like him, we didn't consider him a seven-figure prospect at draft time (Ty's brother Tate, a 2025 draft prospect, is a much different story). Southisene plays with undeniable energy and hustle. He's short, ultra-twitchy little guy with a rhythmic swing, a hand hitch trigger, average bat speed, and a pretty extreme opposite field tendency, which we worry means he's late to the contact point. Southisense controls his body well on defense and should be a viable defender at shortstop, but our hit tool concerns keep him down with the other toolsy little guys at the bottom of the system."
Andry Lara,SP,WSN,2025,,35+,Med,22.2,,,,,"Lara was a bigger, mature-framed teenage pitcher with good present velocity for a prospect his age, but without typical physical projection. He has continued to sit in the 92-95 mph range as he's aged. He endured a pretty severe strikeout regression in 2023 but came out in 2024 commanding a plus slider with robotic consistency. This mid-80s slider allowed Lara to strike out more than a batter per inning at Wilmington and earn an early promotion to Harrisburg; the pitch was generating a swinging strike rate north of 25% as of list publication in late May. It's the lone impact pitch in Lara's repertoire, which will likely limit him to low-leverage relief."
Hunter Dryden,SIRP,SFG,2028,,35+,Med,22.8,,,,,"A pop-up arm from instructs, Dryden was a 17th rounder from Division III Whitworth University, where he was once a two-way player. Dryden sat 91 mph in the most recent college data I have for him, then was up to 95 in the 2024 MLB Draft League before touching 97 for me during instructs. The undersized righty requires whole-body effort to throw that hard, but his fastball has carry that magnifies its bat-missing ability and allows Dryden to have scattershot command. If he can hold that velocity for an entire pro season and improve his breaking ball a little bit, he'll be a big league reliever."
Darwin Ozuna,RF,ATH,2031,,35+,High,17,30,30,45,60,"Ozuna is one of the most exciting athletes in the 2025 international class, a 6-foot-3 outfielder with a wide receiver's build and big showcase tools. Power, speed, and arm strength drive his profile. Both his feel to hit and comfort in center field need significant polish. He signed for $850,000."
Yeferson Vargas,SIRP,LAA,2029,,35+,High,20.7,,,,,"Vargas is a stout, six foot righty who cut his walks substantially in 2024 compared to 2023, while also enjoying a two- or three-tick velocity spike. Vargas' fastball averaged 92-93 mph in 2023 and a scout who saw him earlier this spring had him sitting 93-95, but when I saw him in June (before he became the youngest part of the Luis Garcia deal), he held 95-96 and touched 98 across three innings of work. Vargas also has a snappy curveball in the 81-84 mph range that flashes plus. At his size, he's perhaps more likely to be a reliever, but he made a ton of progress in the last year, especially in the strike-throwing department. Vargas is a young, hard-throwing (likely) relief prospect with a good two-pitch foundation."
John Spikerman,CF,PHI,2028,,35+,Low,22,40,40,40,60,"Spikerman is a plus-running switch-hitter who plays great outfield defense. He's a decisive outfielder with plus range and arm strength. Spikerman has a gap-to-gap line drive approach as a left-handed hitter and is more opposite-field oriented as a righty, though both swings tend to be vulnerable to fastballs at the top of the zone. Speed and defense should allow Spikerman to play a marginal role down the line."
Luis Curvelo,SIRP,TEX,2025,,35+,Med,24.4,,,,,"The tightly wound Curvelo has big arm strength that plays down due to his fastball's shape and his lackluster command. His bullet-spin slider is very nasty and has uncommon depth for a pitch in the 83-87 mph range. It also plays as a strike-stealer in the zone, and Curvelo's feel for landing it is much better than his feel for locating his fastball. He's had success in a one- and two-inning relief role with Seattle's Double-A affiliate in 2024 and looked like an up/down reliever. He became a six-year minor league free agent who the Rangers signed to a big league deal at the start of the 2024-25 offseason."
Enrique Jimenez,C,DET,2029,,35+,High,19.4,40,40,40,30,"Jimenez is an undersized switch-hitting catcher prospect who makes an exciting amount of hard contact for a young hitter his size, it's just often on the ground. Jimenez slashed .242/.366/.376 on the Lakeland complex in 2024 but posted an impressive 42% hard-hit rate. He isn't an especially projectable athlete at a stocky 5-foot-9, and while it's amazing that he had a hard-hit rate that sizeable given his physique, it's tough to project big long-term power for such a small guy. Jimenez also has developing to do on defense; he's not a great ball-blocker right now and lacks the size of a prototypical catcher. He could conceivably be a Garrett Stubbs type of backup."
Listher Sosa,SIRP,ARI,2026,,40,Med,23.6,,,,,"Acquired from Pittsburgh in 2022 trade for Josh VanMeter, Sosa is a big-framed 23-year-old Dominican righty who in 2024 struck out a batter per inning in a relief role at High-A Hillsboro and was promoted to Double-A toward the end of the year. Sosa generates nearly seven feet of extension from a low three-quarters slot and bullies hitters with mid-90s heat. His fastball velocity climbed throughout 2024 and by the end of the season, he was sitting 94-97 mph and touched 99 at Amarillo. When Sosa locates his slider, it's his best offering, but his release isn't consistent enough for it to play like a plus pitch yet. Sosa should debut in an up/down role and has a shot to entrench himself on a staff if his command improves into his mid-to-late-20s."
Michael Arias,MIRP,NYY,2025,,40,High,23.4,,,,,"Arias signed with Toronto as a shortstop but never took a pro at-bat for the Blue Jays. Instead, he was released in the middle of 2020 and moved to the mound around the time he signed with the Cubs in early 2021. He had a breakout 2023 season split between Low- and High-A, during which he made 22 starts, pitched 81.1 innings, struck out 110 batters, and was added to the 40-man in the offseason. The Cubs proactively moved Arias to the bullpen in 2024, and he had a pretty rough year, especially after he was promoted to Iowa, where he walked a batter per inning. Arias has always struggled with walks, but because he was so athletic and new to pitching, it was reasonable to project that he'd get better in this regard. Unfortunately, he hasn't even progressed to 40-grade control yet, and he's still wild enough that it detracts from the effectiveness of his stuff, which is electric. 
This is a funky, low-slot righty with a mid-90s sinker, a potentially plus-plus changeup, and a righty-dowsing slider. Arias' best changeups have devastating finish and are nasty enough for him to miss bats right-on-right. His slot makes it tough for him to get on top of his 82-86 mph slider. It has frisbee shape, but its late, tight movement still makes it an effective bat-misser. Arias has the weapons to deal with hitters of either handedness, and he has experience working multiple innings at a time. He's still projected as a multi-inning weapon with plus stuff, but this is below where Arias, who was traded to the Yankees for cash considerations not long before list publication, has been the last two list cycles because his control just hasn't improved."
Jake Mangum,CF,TBR,2025,,40,Low,29.1,60,70,30,55,"Barack Obama was still in office when Mangum won SEC Freshman of the Year, yet he found himself on a 40-man roster for the first time last November. After slashing a contact-heavy .317/.357/.442 at Triple-A Durham in 2024, Mangum now has a good chance to make his major league debut before his 30th birthday. In exchange for the power conference’s all-time hits lead, Mangum was bestowed with The Curse of the Hand-Eye. He can square up pitches all over the zone from both sides, but his gift for contact puts his most half-cocked swing decisions into action. His top-end exit velos are only a tick below average, but his power production will play another grade below that due to excessive chase. A spare outfielder role is contingent upon Mangum’s passable center field defense, and while he still touts plus run times, he makes do more on clean reads and jumps than closing bursts, providing for few highlights but even fewer adventures."
Cade Kuehler,SIRP,ATL,2026,,40,High,22.8,,,,,"In college, Kuehler looked like a pure relief prospect, but potentially a rather good, quick-moving one, as he'd often touch 98 mph and bend in two good breakers. Deployed as a starter in pro ball, Kuehler's stuff backed up in 2024 and he was in the 89-92 mph range until late June, when he was shut down and required Tommy John. Kuehler's best secondary pitch at Campbell was his slider, which didn't look as good in 2024 for obvious reasons. As a pro, Kuehler seemed to scrap his college curveball and instead began working with a splitter, which was fresh and relatively ineffective. The timing of his surgery gives him a shot to pitch in late 2025, perhaps in the Arizona Fall League. He still has middle relief projection here, it's just a little cloudier than before the injury due to the repertoire changes and suppressed stuff."
Roynier Hernandez,3B,COL,2028,,40,Low,20.3,55,60,30,45,"Hernandez is a stocky, low-to-the-ground athlete with plus defensive hands and terrific feel for the barrel. After two years in the DSL, he slashed .305/.417/.360 and managed a 93% in-zone contact rate on the complex in 2024, but he's still looking for his first pro homer. Hernandez's style of hitting is geared more for opposite field line drive and groundball contact, but he squares the ball up in that direction and is incredibly difficult to make swing and miss. Roynier is compact and strong, but his frame lacks typical strength projection; he has a Yonny Hernández or Neifi Perez type of build. The Rockies have been deploying him all over the infield, and he is slick and sound at every spot. Hernandez's size will limit his impact, but his defense gives him a sort of floor as a low-impact utilityman."
Ronny Cruz,SS,CHC,2030,,35+,High,18.6,35,40,55,40,"The Cubs signed Cruz for $620,000 (the slot value at his pick was $826,000), which was enough for him to forgo his commitment to Miami. Cruz was born in the D.R. but went to high school in South Florida and showed impressive raw power at the Draft Combine in Phoenix (though he was one of the event's slower runners). Cruz’s frame is very wiry and projectable, and he could have plus raw pop down the road. His combination of present juice and long-term physical projection is exciting, but we simply don't know a ton about his contact ability right now. He wasn't a showcase fixture and didn't play complex-level ball after the draft; he didn't take the field until postseason developmental activity, where no stats are kept. Cruz fires his hands low, which we think limits his ability to cover the middle-up part of the zone, especially against fastballs. How he develops in this area is key because we think he'll end up at third base due to a lack of range. Cruz has soft hands on the dirt and enough arm for the left side of the infield, but it’s not a quick-twitch operation and his lateral range might deteriorate as his frame matures. This is a very high-variance prospect with power as his carrying tool."
Brett Auerbach,2B,SFG,2025,,35+,Low,26.6,30,40,40,55,"Auerbach is a hard-swinging 5-foot-8 Swiss Army Knife capable of playing a number of different positions. He swings hard and generates nearly average raw power, which is amazing for a guy his size but also detracts from his ability to make contact due to the effort required. Auerbach doesn't catch very much anymore, but he still plays a mix of second, third, and the outfield corners, which is enough to make him a 27th-man type or bottom-of-the-bench option."
Jacob Lopez,MIRP,ATH,2025,,35+,Low,27.1,,,,,"Lopez had been a seldom-used spot starter/swingman in each of the last two seasons when he was traded to the A's as part of the Jeffrey Springs deal. He has eight career big league appearances, two of them starts, and is down to his final option year. Lopez has spent a majority of the last two years as a starter at Triple-A Durham. He is a low-slot, cross-bodied lefty whose best feature is his slider command. Lopez mixes low-90s four-seamers and sinkers in with a lot of good upper-70s sliders. Fold in an occasional changeup and he has the tools to deal with hitters of both handedness, though none of his pitches is especially nasty. Lopez is a below-average athlete with a lower-effort delivery designed for consistency. This sort of pitcher tends to work as a spot starter until their options dry up, and then they sink or swim in a low-leverage relief role. With just one option left, Lopez has a pretty good shot to make the A’s Opening Day roster and pitch enough in the big leagues to lose rookie status in 2025."
Yendy Gomez,SIRP,LAA,2028,,35+,High,21.3,,,,,"Gomez was barbecuing on the complex for several years before the Angels moved him into a shorter relief role in 2024. He thrived and was dominant in May, June, and July before he was promoted to Inland Empire. The rail-thin Gomez had a velo boost into the 93-96 mph range, and his ability to bully complex-level hiters with that velocity allowed him to work more efficiently than ever and avoid walks. Gomez will also flash a plus two-plane curveball in the 78-83 mph range. He still has problems with mechanical inconsistency that need to be polished, but his uptick in stuff quality, his bodily fluidity, and his remaining physical projection make him another of the many interesting developmental reliever projects in the Angels system."
Carson DeMartini,3B,PHI,2028,,35+,Med,22.3,30,30,50,40,"DeMartini has above-average lefty bat speed, but it takes him quite a bit of noise and effort to generate it, and he had a 27.7% strikeout rate in his draft year at Tech, which is comfortably in red flag territory. His swing is geared for low-ball power in the extreme. DeMartini often collapses to one knee on his biggest swings, and he averaged 20 degrees of launch after the draft at Clearwater, where his K rate was half of what it was in college. Realistically, DeMartini is going to struggle to cover the outer third because of his approach and has a power-over-hit skill set. If he can play multiple defensive positions, then a role similar to the one Kody Clemens has been playing is realistic. DeMartini played third base for the Hokies and got middle infield reps on Cape Cod, then the Phillies played him at all three of those positions after the draft. Plus hands are his defining trait on defense, as DeMartini lacks typical middle infield range and his arm strength is average. He had a labrum surgery on his shoulder in 2023 and it's possible aspects of his defense will improve as he gets further away from that injury."
Omar Alfonzo,C,PIT,2028,,35+,High,21.7,35,40,50,20,"Alfonzo is a power-hitting catching prospect who has now had offensive success in A-ball, with a .252/.357/.403 line in 2024 that undersells how much power there is here (his 53% hard-hit rate helps illustrate it). Lefty-hitting catchers with this kind of power potential are rare. Alfonzo has a low-ball swing and tends to be a little bit late against fastballs, but he's a physical and explosive rotational athlete whose swing's loft should help him get to power. Alfonzo is still very raw as a receiver and framer, but he has an impact arm, and nabbed 33% of would-be basestealers in 2024. How he develops on defense will dictate his ceiling."
Chase Lee,SIRP,DET,2025,,35+,Low,26.6,,,,,"Lee, who came to Detroit from Texas in the Andrew Chafin deal, is a pretty standard sinker/slider sidearmer who has posted strikeout rates up around 30% his entire minor league career while maintaining a below-average walk rate. He doesn't have precise fastball control — he lives in the zone, but not always on the edge of it — and that might be a problem against big leaguers when you're only sitting 88. But both Lee's sinker and slider live in the bottom of the zone consistently enough to consider him a high-probability up/down look reliever."
Elian De La Cruz,RF,ARI,2031,,40,High,17.5,40,40,55,40,"De La Cruz is a physical righty-hitting corner outfield prospect with some of the most advanced raw power in the 2025 international class. There are scouts who have a future 70 on his raw pop. De La Cruz has an odd, shallow load and a short stride. Scouts think his hit tool will mature south of average. He has a pretty standard right field profile for this market."
Thatcher Hurd,MIRP,NYY,2026,,40,Med,22.3,,,,,"Hurd was a famous high school prospect with a great breaking ball, and was a candidate to go in the 2021 comp round. Instead he ended up at UCLA for a year before he became one of several high-profile players to transfer to LSU in 2023. The team was so good during his time there that Hurd never got footing in the rotation, moving into a swingman role again as a junior after two bad starts in early 2024. 
Hurd sits 93-95, even as a starter, and has two plus breaking balls. His curveball almost has too much movement and can be easy to spot out of his hand. His slider became a more frequent part of his mix as the 2024 season went on and will likely be his primary breaking ball as a pro. Hurd has prototypical starter's size, and while his delivery requires quite a bit of effort, it's also a fairly standard look both mechanically and athletically. It's worth developing Hurd as a starter, and the Yankees have tended to coax starter traits out of college relievers less talented than the right-hander, but to this point he's been most successful in long relief."
Tanner Murray,2B,TBR,2026,,40,Low,25.6,50,55,45,40,"Murray is a high-ball hitter with a great minor league contact track record. In 2024, he slashed .290/.328/.424 while playing at least a little bit of each infield position (though none better than average). Murray's swing is driven by his top hand, allowing him to get on top of high pitches with all-fields doubles pop. His stiff lower half and tendency to chase make it tough for him to scoop low secondary pitches, and he swings over top of them fairly often. It's a significant enough issue to cap Murray's ceiling in the bench infield area, or perhaps in a platoon defined by opposing pitchers' tendencies/locations rather than their handedness."
Yujanyer Herrera,SIRP,COL,2026,,40,Low,21.6,,,,,"Herrera had something of a breakout 2024. The gigantic righty began the season in Milwaukee's Low-A bullpen, but by the end of May, he was in the High-A rotation. He was then traded to Colorado as part of the Nick Mears deal and finished the season in Spokane. Herrera's combined line: 100.2 IP, 85 H, 110 K, 34 BB, 3.04 ERA. 
Herrera is listed at 175 pounds but is more like 250. He's a below-average athlete who has struggled to throw strikes at various points during his career, and he still looks like he has below-average command despite his reasonable walk total from 2024. Herrera's best pitch is his slider, a tight mid-80s hellraiser with late bite and good length for how hard it is. Still, too many of his sliders back up on him right now. He has a well-demarcated four-seam/two-seam fastball mix, but no cogent third pitch yet. Herrera's velo keeled off at the very end of the year and he was put on the IL with elbow inflammation in September (he also had a hamstring issue last season); the Rockies left him off the 40-man roster. There's a little too much development needed here to comfortably project Herrera as a starter, but he should be a fine sinker/slider middle reliever in time."
Wilfri De La Cruz,3B,CHC,2031,,35+,High,17.5,45,45,45,40,"De La Cruz has a square-shouldered frame with slightly above-average size and physical projection. Scouts have his defensive fit assessed as a mix of shortstop and third base, with more of the latter. He's strong for age, and though he is a little less projectable than most of his peers, he has an easy, comfortable swing. De La Cruz's bat path is long, and his bat speed from the left side (average) is better than it is from the right. He's had mixed in-game performance as a hitter."
Juan Bello,SP,HOU,2026,,35+,Med,21,,,,,"Bello tossed 89.2 innings in Myrtle Beach’s rotation in 2024 to the tune of a 3.21 ERA while striking out 25.1% of the hitters he faced and limiting his walks to a 7.7% clip in his age-20 season. Bello’s pitch mix is plenty deep to warrant the starter development path, and he can be expected to add a few ticks more velocity on his fastballs as his frame matures. Bello has feel for pounding the zone with his heaters, but the same can’t be said for his secondary offerings. His curveball will routinely showcase plus depth, but he leans heavily on chase because of his inability to land it in the zone with any frequency (39% in-zone in 2024). Bello also has a slider and changeup, with the slider also flashing solid teeth at times, while his changeup relies on late, subtle depth to be effective. As is the case with his curveball, he depends on hitters expanding their zone, as he's unable to land his slider (47% in-zone) and changeup (32% in-zone) in the zone on a regular basis. Bello has enough projectability and existing stuff to be forecast in a depth starter role, but he'll need to harness his secondaries in the zone more often to consistently get more advanced hitters out and turn over a lineup."
Travis Adams,SP,MIN,2025,,35+,Med,25.2,,,,,"Adams covered 127 innings in 2024, striking out 22% of the batters he faced and walking 8% while also giving up 112 hits. Adams' 93-96 mph fastball shows life when he throws it in the upper quadrants but is more running action oriented when it’s lower in the zone. He has a 83-87 mph slider that he'll manipulate the shape of, alternating between a tilting two-planer and a sharp downer, while his firmer, 90-93 mph cutter features short, late movement. He’s toned down the usage of his changeup this year; his best ones will show average fade and sink while others have minimal effectiveness. Adams' overall arsenal is a bit light to hold down a rotation spot at the major league level over the span of a full season, but he should be a quality spot-starter type who transitions to the bullpen once he's out of options."
Jonah Cox,CF,SFG,2027,,35+,Med,23.7,30,50,40,70,"Swapped for Ross Stripling in a deal with Oakland early in 2024, Cox is a speedy center fielder who slashed .267/.377/.370 in a season split between Low- and High-A. Cox's swing has natural jailbreak and he'll lay down some 4.00 run times to first base. Plus range and below-average ball skills combine to make Cox an average all-around center field defender. His swing's length often causes him to be late to the outer third of the plate, and to push contact the other way when he can make it. He's striking out a lot, and his K% exploded after his promotion to High-A (31.9%). He probably won't hit enough to be a relevant offensive player, but the impact of his speed (he stole 58 bases in 67 attempts last year) and his competent defense should allow for a bottom-of-the-40-man role."
Sam Stuhr,SP,ATH,2028,,35+,Med,22.6,,,,,"Stuhr is a fantastic small school developmental pitching prospect out of Portland, Oregon. He spent a year at a Washington JUCO and another at Oregon State (where he didn't pitch at all) before settling in for 80 innings at the Portland in his draft year. Stuhr has a prototypical pitcher's build at a long-levered 6-foot-2 or so, and he's a loose, athletic mover. He held mid-90s velocity all year and his two breaking balls generated plus rates of miss against small school competition. But Stuhr's feel for location is not good right now. He walked 45 batters in his 80 innings as a junior and is pretty loose in the strike zone with all of his pitches. He's behind most 22-year-olds in terms of pitchability and craftsmanship, but he pitched in fewer than 10 total college games until his draft year, so that isn't surprising. Stuhr is a deep projection sleeper."
Keythel Key,SIRP,LAA,2027,,35+,High,21.5,,,,,"Key is a projectable 21-year-old developmental project whose max-effort delivery has made it very tough for him to throw strikes so far in pro ball. At a lanky 6-foot-3, he maintained mid-90s velocity throughout 94 regular season innings in 2024, and was 93-97 with natural cut during instructs. He complements that with a 76-83 mph slurve, which Key has better feel for locating than his fastball.  Especially if he gets a bump to his heater with a move to the bullpen (ideally his breaking ball will become faster, too), he has the look of a pretty standard middle reliever. Key's changeup is good enough to merit at least one more year of development as a starter just in case he starts locating more consistently."
Elison Joseph,SIRP,ATL,2027,,35+,High,24.2,,,,,"Joseph is a hard-throwing Dominican righty with some of the best arm strength in the Braves system. He ended the 2024 season at Double-A Mississippi and posted a combined 2.04 ERA and 34.1% strikeout rate, but he wasn't put on the 40-man and went unselected in the Rule 5 Draft because of how wild he is. 
So inconsistent is Joseph's release point that, as I noted last year, his nickname could be Elison ""Jesus, Mary and"" Joseph, which is what I found myself muttering watching his catchers constantly sprint to the backstop to retrieve an errant pitch. But if things click for Joseph, he's going to be a high-leverage reliever. His fastball averaged 97 mph and has plus vertical break from a lower-than-average release point. He tends to use it as a finishing pitch because Joseph struggles to locate it in the zone and threw it for strikes just 56% of the time last year. His slider, an 85-88 mph mixed bag of some true sliders and lots that have more cutter-y shape, is his most-used pitch. Joseph's delivery isn't violent or messy, he simply lacks tactile feel for release. If he can find even 40-grade control, he's going to be a great weapon. He'll likely begin his major league career in an up/down capacity and root himself into a more consistent role if he can throw strikes in front of the big league manager."
Jaydenn  Estanista,SIRP,PHI,2027,,35+,High,23.5,,,,,"Estanista is a frustrating, lightning-armed righty with a riding mid-90s fastball and plus-flashing slider. He might have a cutter and slider, or Estanista's release may be so inconsistent that it just appears he has two breaking balls. His ideal pitcher's build, a spindly 6-foot-3, and athleticism are why he's on the main section of the list even though Estanista has struggled with walks throughout his career. His 2024 walk rate (13.6%) is a stark improvement compared to 2023. Estanista was sitting 95-96 with Team Netherlands during the offseason and has the stuff to be a good middle reliever if he can develop 40-grade control."
Tyler Owens,SIRP,DET,2025,,35+,Med,24.2,,,,,"Traded twice in 2024, his first full season as a reliever, Owens’ new spot on the 40-man makes him a prime candidate to be part of the Tigers’ bullpen churn after 51.2 innings of sub-3.00 ERA work in Double-A. The hirsute right-hander dips deep enough into his back leg and draws his arm low enough that he might rub some dirt on the baseball mid-delivery one of these days. On top of his 5-foot-10 listing, the motion creates an upshoot feel to a high-90s fastball that lacks the vert to be a bat-misser in the upper third but has avoided damage thus far. Similar things could be said of his high-80s slider, which he can reliably backdoor for strikes, but which is pushed into the zone thigh-high a little too often by his control-over-command approach.
Owens has been toying with a 88-89 mph splitter in spring training, which has flashed good action but is understandably in a preliminary stage in terms of his feel for locating it. Until it emerges, Owens looks like an up-and-down righty who has an intriguing approach but lacks the command or signature weapon for leverage work."
T.J. Rumfield,1B,NYY,2026,,40,Low,24.9,55,55,45,30,"It felt like the Phillies (who drafted him) and then the Yankees (who traded Nick Nelson and Donny Sands for him and Joel Valdez) might be getting in on the ground floor of a tip-of-the-iceberg prospect in Rumfield, who barely played as an underclassman at Texas Tech and then had a great draft year in his only real college season of at-bats at Virginia Tech. Rumfield has posted slightly above-average batting lines at every minor league level with more robust power coming in the last couple of years. In a 2024 spent mostly at Scranton, he slashed .294/.370/.454 with 15 homers and posted very impressive contact stats — 81% contact%, 88% in-zone — that would be plus on a big league scale. This extended to hard fastballs, as Rumfield had an 87% contact rate against heaters 94 mph and above. He lacks the power of a typical first baseman, but he puts the bat on the ball enough to be considered a viable low-end option. He's injury insurance for Paul Goldschmidt and could probably start for a small handful of teams toward the bottom of the competitive continuum."
Drew Dowd,SP,TBR,2027,,40,Med,23.2,,,,,"Dowd shifted into the bullpen while he was at Stanford, but the Rays have revisited a starting role for him, and Dowd's first pro season went about as well as one could have hoped. At Charleston, he worked 110.2 innings (easily a career high) and had a 2.85 ERA and a 9.9% walk rate, which tied a career-low from his college days. By the very end the season, Dowd was twirling some great six- and seven-inning starts with a workable number of walks.
Dowd was sitting 89-92 mph as a starter, and his two most-used secondary pitches — a mid-80s changeup and slider — are both below-average pitches that he commanded surprisingly well in 2024. It appeared Dowd was forcing himself to pitch off of his two worse secondary offerings in an effort to develop them rather than lean on his knee-buckling curveball, which was maybe the best breaking ball in the entire 2023 draft. Dowd isn't great at creating movement on either his changeup or slider, but he is pretty good at locating them, especially for a guy who was mostly a college reliever. As good as his curveball is, its effectiveness is more about spin efficiency and plane than raw spin, so its excellence won't necessarily translate into a good slider (his slider averages about 2,300 rpm). Dowd's vertical arm slot has long helped his fastball play at the belt, which pairs nicely with the curveball. If indeed he can find a third pitch, he'll profile as a backend starter; if not, then he'll hopefully throw a little harder in the bullpen and utilize his curveball a lot more."
Luichi Casilla,SIRP,COL,2028,,40,High,20.3,,,,,"A high-waisted, bubble-butted southpaw with a rectangular frame, Casilla was one of the more exciting pop-up arms of early 2024 backfield action, as the teenage lefty's fastball was routinely in the 95-98 mph range, and he flashed a nasty two-planed breaking ball. Frustratingly hittable and wild, he posted a 32.9% K% and 16.2% BB% in 12 regular season appearances, then Casilla seemed to get hurt during Instructional League activity toward the end of September. The exact severity of the injury is unclear, but it looked pretty bad. His fastball angle and shape cause it to play beneath its velocity, his command dilutes the effectiveness of his entire repertoire, and he needs to develop a third pitch in order to start, but Casilla's arm strength and breaking ball quality are a great starting point for a young pitcher. If his injury was bad enough to cost him a portion of 2025, it will funnel him further toward a reliever future, though he has late-inning upside in that role."
Caleb Kilian,MIRP,CHC,2025,,35+,Med,27.8,,,,,"Kilian has pitched in parts of three big league seasons but not enough to lose rookie eligibility. A 2019 eighth rounder out of Texas Tech, Kilian made stylistic changes to his pitching in pro ball, had a velo spike, and was sent from San Francisco to Chicago as part of the Kris Bryant trade. During the spring of 2023, Kilian's fastball was touching 101, but it lasted for literally a couple of starts before a teres major strain shelved him until the middle of 2024. When Kilian came back, he was sitting 94. He attacks with a bunch of different breaking balls (cutter, sweeper, knuckle curve), only one of which is plus. Barring a velo rebound, Kilian looks like a spot starter."
Pedro Blanco,1B,ARI,2030,,35+,High,17.9,45,40,60,30,"Blanco is a lefty power projection bat who slugged .446 in 2024, his first pro season. Blanco has precocious power and bat speed, and doesn't turn 18 until April. A lot of his swings are out of control, but if Blanco can reign that in as he continues to grow, he might end up with both really big power and enough of a hit tool to weaponize it. He was also among the more projectable DSL D-backs hitters, at a well-built 6-foot-1 or so. Blanco played a mix of left field and first base in 2024, but if he gets as big and strong as we hope he'll be, he'll likely end up at first. Of the fun teenage hitters in this FV tier of Arizona's system, Blanco is the one we think has the best chance to have an impact hitter."
Diego Velasquez,SS,SFG,2027,,35+,Med,21.5,50,55,30,40,"Velasquez has a strong contact track record for a switch-hitting infielder his age, and kept his strikeout rate under 20% again in 2024, as he slashed .288/.368/.384 and spent the last month and a half of the season at Double-A. Velasquez is best at making low-ball contact, a tendency he exhibits from both sides of the plate. He peppers both gaps with line drive contact as a lefty, and has an inside out style (sends fastballs oppo, pulls slower stuff) from the right side. Of squat, softer build, Velasquez lacks power projection, and his ceiling is likely capped in the utility infield area. On defense, Velasquez lacks range, but he makes up for it with great short-area skills and hands. He's crafty and finds a way to get the ball where it needs to be in time. It's going to be important for him to keep his body in check so he can retain what little range he currently has. So long as he can do that, he fits the bill as a roster's sixth infielder, a light-hitting contact bat with middle infield capability."
Ryan Cusick,SIRP,ATH,2025,,35+,High,25.4,,,,,"Cusick, who was part of the Matt Olson trade, has rebounded a bit after two years of declining velocity. He was sitting 95-96 as a starter in early 2024, then missed time with a core muscle strain. A few weeks after he returned, Cusick was moved to the bullpen and he was pretty dominant down the stretch, allowing a .191 opponents batting average after the switch to relief. Cusick had added a cutter to his mix early in the year, but it was less a part of his repertoire after the move to the 'pen. His ability to locate his slider is better than that of his fastball. His ceiling in relief is limited by his lack of command, but he has an above-average slider and an average cutter to back up his heater. Cusick is tracking like an up/down relief type who could slide into a lower-leverage on-roster role if his command exceeds its projection."
David Mershon,CF,LAA,2027,,35+,Med,21.8,35,40,30,70,"Mershon signed for an over-slot $405,000 as an 18th-round draft-eligible sophomore. He mostly played shortstop at Mississippi State (where he hit a career .329/.447/.447) and he's played mostly second base so far in pro ball, but his excellent speed (and flub-prone hands) make him a candidate to explore center field. Indeed, Mershon got reps in center field after he signed and again in the 2024 Arizona Fall League, where his time was cut short by what looked like a hammy tweak suffered on a dive for a shallow fly ball. Ji Hwan Bae and Garrett Hampson are examples of the sort of role Mershon could grow into as a defender. On offense, he has some pull power as a right-handed hitter and is more of a gap-pepperer from the left side. He has a shot to play a multi-positional bench role and impact the game as a runner."
Kevin Kilpatrick Jr.,CF,ATL,2027,,35+,Med,24.3,30,30,40,60,"Kilpatrick is a good-gloved center field prospect who has now posted two consecutive years of below-average offensive performance at High-A Rome, with his wRC+ living in the 89-91 range each time. Kilpatrick's swing takes too long to enter the hitting zone, and when he makes contact, it is often down the first base line. He is very unlikely to make any kind of long-term offensive impact, but his speed and ability to play a great center field should allow him to have a big league career as a defensive replacement and pinch-runner. KJ stole 50 bases in 59 attempts last year and will run 4.2 flat from home to first. On defense, his range is plus, his routes are crisp, and his ball skills are terrific. He's a fringe 40-man type who'll probably hop around to various orgs throughout his lifetime as a pro."
Tanner Kohlhepp,SIRP,DET,2026,,35+,Med,25.8,,,,,"Drafted in 2021, Kohlhepp didn't make his pro debut until his walk-prone 2023 campaign in Lakeland. In 2024, he got his walks under control (for a reliever, anyway) and K'd 78 hitters in 61.1 innings at West Michigan. Kohlhepp is in the Justin Topa mold. He throws really hard for a sidearmer and can create bat-missing sink on his changeup. His slot makes his upper-80s slider tough on righties, though overall that pitch is closer to average. If he can continue to polish his command, Kohlhepp will be a reliable middle-inning option who can face hitters of either handedness because of his changeup quality. His sketchy control makes it more likely that Kohlhepp plays an up/down role."
Brando Mayea,CF,NYY,2028,,40,Med,19.5,30,40,40,60,"One of the top prospects in the 2023 international class, Mayea signed with New York for $4.3 million and spent his first pro season in the DSL, where he slashed .276/.382/.400. Mayea looked like a speedy, glove-first center field prospect in his debut season. Last list cycle, I compared him to Albert Almora or Manny Margot, but he K'd too much in 2024 for those comparisons to continue. Mayea's footwork in the box is often poorly timed, and his hands load deep and late, causing him to push an inordinate amount of contact the opposite way when he's able to make it. His speed and defense are both plus, as Mayea puts down some jailbreak times in the 4.1s, and his reads and routes are decisive and polished. He currently looks like a glove-oriented fifth outfielder and probably needs a swing adjustment to be more."
Nathan Flewelling,C,TBR,2028,,40,High,18.4,40,40,50,30,"Flewelling is an exciting developmental catcher prospect with big power potential. He hit a ball 112 mph at the Combine, and his swing has big hip-and-shoulder separation and explosion. He was also very young for the 2024 draft class. Flewelling is a very raw receiver with an average arm, a from-scratch project behind the plate as a defender. He's risky and is likely to be a slow burn even if things work out for him, but he has considerable upside as a power-hitting lefty catcher."
Will Sanders,SP,CHC,2026,,35+,Low,23,,,,,"Sanders had a down 2023 junior spring at South Carolina because of an injury to his knee and lower fibula that caused him pain during the season, even before he was shut down for most of May and after the draft. His 2024 pro debut came with an assignment to High-A South Bend, where Sanders has looked like he did in college, a spot starter or backend guy. He made 23 starts, pitched 96.2 total innings (exceeding five innings in just two starts all year) and posted a 4.66 ERA. Sanders' command is important to his success because he has a below-average fastball with mediocre velocity and movement. He can get ahead of hitters by landing his breaking balls for strikes, and Sanders uses his changeup as an action pitch in the zone to garner weak contact early in counts. His walk rate in 2024 (10.3% prior to a one-start promotion to Tennessee) was pretty disappointing and needs to improve if he is going to be a true no. 5 starter. The Cubs tend to shorten the arm actions of their pitching prospects, which hasn't happened yet with Sanders. His size and the ease of his delivery should at least help him eating innings. Here he's evaluated as a future spot starter."
Gian Zapata,CF,ARI,2029,,35+,High,19.5,30,40,55,55,"Among the most physically projectable athletes in the 2023 IFA class, Zapata is a typical Diamondbacks international prospect, with a frame you can dream on and a lot of hit tool risk. Zapata signed for just shy of $1 million and hit .254/.364/.522 in his 2023 DSL debut, but because his underlying contact rates were rather concerning (in the 61-64% range the last two season), he remained in the D.R. for the start of 2024 as well. Zapata was producing there again in 2024 and was promoted to the ACL, where he was clearly overmatched for the final few weeks of the season. Zapata is still not very strong with the bat. He takes a lot of long, awkward swings and looks stiff in the lower body, but he's huge and lanky and has a chance to grow into enormous power and shorten up his swing in the process. He's a high-variance prospect who is still five years or so away, and his contact rates are concerning enough to put Zapata in more of a sleeper/flier FV bucket."
Maui Ahuna,SS,SFG,2027,,35+,Med,23.1,30,40,40,50,"Ahuna spent his first two college seasons at Kansas and had one of the hottest 2022's in college baseball. He slashed .396/.479/.634 and put himself in the first round mix before transferring to Tennessee for his draft year. That next season was rocky. He was ineligible to play at the start of the season because Tennessee didn't properly handle some clerical aspects of his transfer, and then Ahuna played through a stress reaction in his back all year and K'd at a daming 31% clip. He fell to the fourth round. Hopes for a bounce back were dashed as Ahuna dealt with more injuries in 2024, playing in just 23 non-rehab games and eventually needing mid-season Tommy John surgery. 
Ahuna's long, low-ball swing makes it tough for him to pull the baseball, and he'll probably swing underneath a lot of fastballs as he climbs the minors, unless a truly healthy return means new things for his swing. Amid all these injuries, Ahuna has always looked good playing defense. His hands, acrobatic actions, and big time arm are all fits at short. When Ahuna returns, he'll be 23 and yet to play a game above Low-A. He's purely a bounce-back candidate entering 2025."
Justin Sterner,SIRP,ATH,2025,,35+,Low,28.6,,,,,"Signed as an undrafted free agent by Miami after the 2020 draft and later traded for David Hess, Sterner was claimed off waivers from the Rays during the 2024-25 offseason. He has a plus slider and an upshot fastball that lives entirely off its angle and deception. Sterner might have the shortest arm circle in baseball; it looks more like a shot putter's motion and it definitely adds an element of deception to his delivery. His four-seamer sits between 92-94 mph and the aforementioned arm action allows it to sneak up on hitters up in the zone. Sterner is throwing both a slider and cutter, the former a 79-82 mph two-plane bender, while the latter is a short, upper-80s offering with quick, subtle action. Sterner will likely fill an up/down reliever role in the coming years."
Matthew Lugo,LF,LAA,2025,,35+,High,23.9,40,50,50,55,"Lugo was acquired from Boston at the 2024 deadline as part of a four-player package in exchange for reliever Luis García. Carlos Beltrán's nephew moved to the outfield full-time in 2024 and it appeared as though a swing change unlocked an extra gear of power for him, as Lugo hit 17 home runs (one shy of his career high) in just 79 games. Lugo's hands are setting up earlier than before, and the path they take to load has changed. His mistake-crushing style had him on pace to hit 30 homers in the minors before he was shut down with a thumb injury after just one game in the Angels org. 
Always geared for pull-side lift, there hasn't been a dramatic change to Lugo's batted ball profile, but he hit the ball harder last year and chased less. Hell-bent on pulling the baseball, Lugo struggles to cover the outer third of the zone and swings inside of a ton of pitches out there. Given his projected hit tool limitations (his contact rates were average in 2024, but this eval thinks his approach will make it tough to sustain that) and the way his defensive versatility has trended down, he looks more like an above-replacement up/down outfielder than a consistent role player. This is a well-built young athlete who'll probably play high-level pro baseball for quite a while, and if he can successfully revisit the infield during that time, then we're talking about a more rosterable player."
Luis Guanipa,CF,ATL,2027,,35+,Med,19.3,45,55,40,60,"Guanipa, who signed for $2.5 million in 2023, had a fair DSL debut that year and then dealt with a hamstring injury for much of 2024. It limited him to 52 games and a .219/.286/.291 line. A smaller prospect, Guanipa would require twitch and explosion to make a big impact because he lacks meaningful size and strength, but his tools so far have looked pretty vanilla. He has the wheels to continue developing in center field, but his impact on offense feels like it will need to come from special contact ability, which to this point has been average. At the moment, Guanipa looks more like a future part-timer than a dynamic leadoff man."
Greg Jones,CF,COL,2025,,35+,High,27.1,20,20,30,80,"Jones is among the most fun to watch players in the minors. He's a top-of-the-scale athlete who plays spectacular (albeit inconsistent) defense at several positions, and he has incredible speed and above-average raw power. Now 26, Jones still hasn't made progress in a few key areas, namely his infield hands and arm accuracy, and his contact hitting. He hit .267/.344/.453 in his first season in the Rockies system, but K'd at a 35.5% clip, which is actually a good bit better than his 2023 rate (38.8%). Jones swings pretty hard and can tag a fastball, but he's hapless against secondary stuff; this is the kind of guy who'd hit .180 or so with regular reps. 
At a certain point it was feasible that a young, switch-hitting Jones would make meaningful progress in this area, but that hasn't happened. Instead, it's via his speed and defense that Jones remains relevant. Though he struggled with flubs and underthrows, Jones was developed solely at shortstop for his first four years in the Rays system and wasn't given run in center field until 2023. Traded to Colorado for Joe Rock that offseason, he's now been exposed to a mix of CF/SS/2B and sometimes plays all three like your friendly neighborhood Spiderman, with highlight-reel acrobatics. Too often, though, Jones is flub-prone on the infield, and his throwing is much, much better from the outfield, where his relative inexperience still sometimes shows. He's below average at short and has played just eight games at second, but Jones is such an unbelievable athlete that I'm still betting he becomes a very special defensive center fielder in his late 20s. He still has value as a late-game runner and defender."
Andrew Navigato,SS,DET,2026,,35+,Low,26.8,45,45,45,45,"Navigato would be a 40-FV player were he just a little bit better of an infield defender. Though he's played all over the place (2B/3B/SS/LF/RF), his hands make him a bit more mistake-prone than is ideal for a true utility infielder. However, Navigato is a fairly well-rounded hitter. He lacks a plus offensive tool, but his top hand is strong through contact, allowing him to get to the modest (but relevant) power he has. He's capable of generating extra-base pop to all fields, and his swing has gotten simpler and more compact as he has gotten stronger into his mid-20s. In 2024, he posted a 124 wRC+ at Toledo and slugged 21 homers, but he wasn't put on the 40-man nor was he selected in the Rule 5 Draft. He strikes us as an above-replacement player who'll likely hop on and off the bottom of teams' 40-man rosters during his prime, which is now."
Carson Coleman,SIRP,NYY,2025,,40,High,27,,,,,"Coleman had Tommy John in early April of 2023. The Rangers selected him in the Rule 5 Draft that offseason, then returned him to the Yankees on 40-man deadline day after the 2024 season; he never threw a pitch in Texas' org. Last we saw Coleman, the Yankees were able to add about four ticks to his fastball relative to when he signed after the 2020 draft, and when you combine the mid-90s velocity with his heater’s nasty uphill angle and tailing action, healthy Coleman now has a vicious plus-plus fastball. That is almost solely why he was able to punch 95 tickets in just 63.1 innings throughout a 2022 spent mostly as Somerset’s closer. His command and secondary pitches were all well below average that season, and at least one other aspect of Coleman’s skill set needs to evolve if he’s going to an impact big leaguer."
Maykel Coret,RF,TBR,2031,,40,High,17.5,30,30,50,55,"Coret signed for $1.6 million in January and will begin his pro career in the 2025 DSL. He is a fairly typical righty-hitting corner outfield prospect from the international market. He has a big, projectable frame and already swings quite hard. His hands work in a long loop, and Coret lacks precise feel for the barrel. Coret has a sizable amount of hit tool risk for this reason, with his contact performance the key first-year variable to monitor here."
Pedro Ramirez,3B,CHC,2027,,35+,Low,21,55,55,30,40,"A skilled, undersized 2B/3B (and sometimes left fielder), Ramirez is a compact switch-hitter with above-average feel for contact and way, way below-average power. He's a smaller, relatively unexplosive guy, but Ramirez has good feel for contact from both sides of the plate (especially the right) and is a good defensive player at multiple positions. He slashed .284/.348/.381 at High-A in 2024, a line that is commensurate with Ramirez's talent. A lack of power caps his ceiling to a utility role that doesn't include shortstop."
Blake Walston,SP,ARI,2025,,35+,Med,23.8,,,,,"Walston threw 149.1 innings at Reno in 2023 and made his big league debut early in 2024 in a spot starter role. After an IL stint (left elbow inflammation), Walston was called up again in September and was asked to work in long relief. His repertoire depth and remaining option years make it likely he will be deployed in a similar role for at least the next couple of seasons. Walston has never thrown quite as hard as when he was a high school senior and young pro. His heater has averaged about 91 mph each of the last several seasons, and Walston mixes in a panoply of other offerings to get by. He has a four-seamer, two-seamer, cutter, slider, curveball, and changeup, all of which are average or below. Walston lacks precise command, but his delivery is simple and effortless, which should allow him to throw enough strikes to start or provide efficient, low-leverage length out of the bullpen."
Aeverson Arteaga,SS,SFG,2027,,35+,Med,22,30,40,40,50,"Arteaga signed for $1 million in 2019 and was tough to scout until 2021 because of travel restrictions in and out of Venezuela during the meat of the pandemic. He had two solid offensive seasons in 2022 and 2023, when he hit 14 and 17 homers, respectively, as a young-for-the-level shortstop. He had surgery for thoracic outlet syndrome after the 2023 season and didn't return until late July of last year. He only played 24 games in 2024 and picked up some postseason reps in the Venezuelan Winter League. Arteaga was a viable shortstop defender prior to the surgery and looks good again coming out of rehab. That's what will carry his profile, as Arteaga has had issues with chase and strikeouts, and will likely continue to in a way that caps his forecast in the utility infielder range. He'll be 22 in March and is of medium build, so it's unlikely Arteaga will develop the big power needed to be an impact shortstop who also strikes out nearly 30% of the time."
Stevie Emanuels,SIRP,ATH,2025,,35+,Low,26.2,,,,,"Emanuels experienced a three-tick velo bump in 2023 and carried his 94-96 mph fastball into the 2024 season. He also incorporated a cutter into his repertoire, which now gives him three different breaking ball shapes to show hitters. He deploys cutters, sliders, and curveballs across a 77-90 mph range, so even though hitters can reliably look for movement to one half of the plate, they can't anticipate speed and shape. Emanuels' cutter remains his best secondary weapon, with late, quick action that allows it to stay off barrels. Both his curveball and slider tend to lack sharp break and are more complementary pieces to his fastball and cutter. Emanuels was limited to just 18 innings of work between Double- and Triple-A in 2024 after a shoulder strain resulted in a 60-day IL stint. Depending on his long-term injury prognosis, Emanuels looks bound for an up/down relief role."
Jadiel Sanchez,RF,LAA,2025,,35+,Med,23.9,55,55,40,50,"Sanchez looks like the same player he was when the Angels acquired him from Philly as part of the Noah Syndergaard trade, which is a positive in some ways and a negative in others. The good: Sanchez is a lean and lanky switch-hitter who has demonstrated above-average overall feel for contact. The bad: He's been rail thin for basically his whole career and has yet to get any stronger. Sanchez's 2024 statline was pretty terrible, but Tri-City is a horrible place to hit. Sanchez's lefty swing is beautiful and pure, and he can pull pitches on the inner third with power. It may end up being sexier looking than it is functional against big league velocity, but it's a good enough reason to stay on Sanchez as a prospect to some extent. His underlying contact numbers are a bit better than average, and Sanchez's build and bodily looseness indicate athletic longevity. His ceiling is capped by a lack of physicality, but there are still fifth outfielder tools here."
Dylan Dodd,SP,ATL,2025,,35+,Low,26.8,,,,,"Dodd began his college career at Kankakee Community College in Illinois before matriculating to Southeast Missouri State for three more years. He didn't truly establish himself until 2021, his fourth year removed from high school, when Dodd struck out 120 batters and walked just 17 in 96.2 innings. The Braves made him their third round pick, altered his delivery, and coaxed a little more velo and fastball playability out of him. The following year, Dodd raced all the way to Triple-A in his first full season while maintaining his stuff across a 30-inning workload increase. Since then, Dodd has struggled to break through to the next level. He had a great 2023 spring training and made seven big league starts but was knocked around. He spent virtually all of 2024 in the minors, with just a single two-inning relief appearance in the big leagues. During the spring of 2025, he made just one Grapefruit League appearance before he was optioned. Dodd still throws strikes with all of his pitches (fastball, cutter, changeup and a slider that's a distant fourth), but they have turned out to be very vulnerable to damage. Each has an xwOBA on contact north of .370, and that was against Triple-A hitters in 2024. His strike-throwing makes him a viable spot starter, but it's tough to project Dodd into a permanent rotation spot."
Doug Nikhazy,MIRP,CLE,2025,,35+,Med,25.6,,,,,"A dominant college starter despite 30-grade velocity and middling control, Nikhazy has really struggled to throw strikes as a pro. He is throwing a little harder than he was at Ole Miss, sitting more 90-93 now, and his heater's ride and angle make it viable at that velocity. He's also developed a new, hard slider/cutter in pro ball, and his curveball has plus-plus spin, showing a huge spike above his college spin rate. Nikhazy has made basically no progress as a strike-thrower, but his fiery on-mound demeanor and plus secondary stuff should still give him utility as a long reliever, a role where his sneaky fastball could play up a little more than it has as a starter."
Benny Montgomery,CF,COL,2025,,35+,Med,22.6,20,20,40,60,"Montgomery was a divisive amateur, a big-framed center field prospect with a rare power/speed combo and fair batted ball showcase performance for a cold weather guy. Detractors were scared of how cacophonous his swing was and thought he'd need an overhaul to hit at all in pro ball, while model-driven teams rounded down on Montgomery because he was nearly 19 on draft day. The Rockies picked Montgomery eighth overall, then he had a big first full season (.313/.394/.502 at Low-A) but struck out at an alarming rate. That carried into 2023, when Benny's output dipped closer to league average. He barely played in 2024, dislocating his left shoulder and damaging the capsule and labrum during an outfield dive. He had season-ending surgery after just 11 games at Hartford. 
Montgomery went to Puerto Rico for winter ball after the season, and though he had clearly spent a lot of his rehab in the weight room, his swing is still noisy and odd. Montgomery's added mass hasn't cost him much speed, but he's still a tentative and clumsy defender in center field. Missing 2024 reps because of his injury really stings. Rust accumulates with months off, and Montgomery is returning from a severe injury he suffered while playing defense; it's fair to give him time to get comfortable out there. Still, even if he does, I fear it will be rendered moot by the lack of functionality in Benny's swing. He's a 64% contact rate guy combined in 2023 and 2024 (Cactus League, Clemente League, scraps from Hartford), which is a pretty scary number. Because he's so young and physically impressive, and plays hard, Montgomery is still a prospect, but it doesn't appear he's going to actualize his tools into real production without a swing overhaul."
Josh Randall,SP,DET,2027,,35+,Med,22.5,,,,,"Randall spent his first two collegiate seasons at Arizona, where he barely pitched in 2023 due to injury. In 2024, his lone season as a starter for the University of San Diego, he made 14 starts, worked 72.1 innings, posted a 3.73 ERA, 1.22 WHIP, 25.6% K% and 8.2% BB%, and then made two appearances at Lakeland after the draft. Randall is a gigantic dude at a hulking 6-foot-4. He works from a lower arm slot with a sink/tail fastball in the 93-96 mph range. Both of Randall's secondaries (a slider and a changeup) need pro dev, which isn't shocking considering he only started for one year at USD. He's a candidate for a sweeper because of his arm slot, and Detroit's ability to coax good changeups out of their pitching prospects portends good things for Randall and his sinker-oriented fastball approach."
Evan Reifert,SIRP,WSN,2025,,40,Med,25.9,,,,,"Reifert transferred from an Iowa JUCO to Central Missouri, became a $20,000 undrafted free agent of the Brewers after the draft in 2020, and then was flipped for big league role player Mike Brosseau the following November. He was limited to just 44 combined innings in 2022 and 2023 due to multiple injuries. He spent 2024 at Double-A Montgomery, had a mostly healthy year, and struck out 40% of opposing batters, while posting a career-best 10% walk rate. Reifert’s slider is incredible, a mid-80s knee-buckler that he throws more than his fastball; it often freezes hitters even when Reifert hangs it and he was throwing it a bit harder than he was in 2023. Reifert’s fastball sits 94-96 mph and has running action out of his three-quarters arm slot. It tends to find the meat of the zone (or miss the zone entirely) much more than the up/arm-side location where it would play best. Reifert will probably always be a little too shaky of a strike-thrower to regularly warrant high-leverage assignments, but he has an elite pitch and plus arm strength, which should let him play a middle inning role immediately."
Warel Solano,SS,TBR,2031,,40,High,17.5,40,40,45,50,"While most of the other 2025 international shortstop prospects who signed for less than $2 million are good defenders without a ton of offensive upside, Solano's longer-levered frame has more room for strength at maturity, and with that will hopefully come power. That said, Solano does have hit tool risk. He currently has an enormous bat wrap and a huge stride that might be too elaborate to time consistently. He's a graceful defender for his size and will hopefully grow into another grade of arm strength as he fills out. He's a risky power projection shortstop prospect who signed for a shade over $1 million."
BJ Murray Jr.,3B,CHC,2025,,35+,Low,25.2,50,50,40,45,"Born in the Bahamas (he competed for Great Britain in the 2023 WBC), Murray went to high school and college in Florida and until 2024 had put together an impressive, well-rounded offensive résumé in pro ball. He's a career .250/.366/.411 hitter (plate discipline has been his lone plus attribute), but he had a tough first half at Iowa and, after an IL stint encompassing most of August, Murray was demoted to Tennessee for the stretch run and hit .155 there. He was left off the Cubs' 40-man roster and went unselected in the Rule 5 Draft. Murray is a patient switch-hitter with doubles pop. He has below-average range but plus actions and hands, which might make him a plus first base defender with more reps. He lacks the loud offensive tools of a premium corner role player but, despite his pretty terrible 2024, he still projects as an on-roster player who'd accumulate 1 WAR if you gave him lots of at-bats."
Juan Corniel,SS,ARI,2026,,35+,High,22.5,30,50,30,60,"For a little while in the low minors, it looked like Corniel might develop enough of a bat to be a high-end utilityman, but he hasn't once had an above-average offensive season and is a glove-only prospect at this point. But oh boy, can he play defense. Corniel was quickly promoted to Triple-A when injuries wreaked havoc on Arizona's big league shortstop situation in 2024, because if the injuries had cut any deeper, he'd have easily been the most capable shortstop defender in the entire org. He has premium range and athleticism, plus hands, and a plus-plus arm. Corniel can make all the plays at short and he has experience at second and third base, though he played less at those spots in 2024. His defensive ability is going to enable Corniel to play in the big leagues as a team's fifth or sixth infielder."
Cole Foster,SS,SFG,2027,,35+,Low,23.5,30,40,30,40,"Foster slashed .213/.293/.318 over 335 plate appearances between the Giants A-ball affiliates in 2024, which wasn't exactly an aggressive assignment for a third round pick out of an SEC school. Foster is a switch-hitter who did have some success against southpaws in 2024; he put up a .815 OPS over 68 plate appearances against lefties but a meager .549 versus right-handed pitchers. Foster’s left-handed swing often whiffs underneath fastballs, while his right-handed swing produces more bat speed and adjustability in its path. Foster’s defensive ability is far and away his carrying tool. His internal clock is well-timed, his arm stroke is true and consistent (plenty for the left side of the infield), and his hands are slick and sure. Still, a 26% K rate in A-ball is damning for a college shortstop, and Foster's ceiling is that of a utility infielder without a playable offensive attribute."
Eric Cerantola,SIRP,KCR,2025,,35+,High,24.9,,,,,"Cerantola entered his draft year as a potential first round pick because of the quality of his stuff, but he struggled so badly with control that he barely remained part of Mississippi State's staff and only worked 17 innings as a junior. He fell to the fifth round and the Royals tried to develop him as a starter until 2023, when Cerantola began to work out of the bullpen most of the time. He's yo-yo'd between the rotation and relief a couple more times but really began to thrive toward the end of 2024, when he struck out 43 over his final 28 innings of work. Cerantola's best pitch is his mid-80s bullet slider, which has plus velocity and depth. That played like an elite pitch in 2024 and could spearhead a late-inning relief fit for Cerantola if he can become a more consistent strike-thrower. For now, he has middle relief projection."
Gage Jump,SIRP,ATH,2026,,35+,Med,22,,,,,"Another in a growing line of high-profile LSU transfers, Jump (who had TJ during his freshman season) has big fastball carry, which he's had since high school. He sits 93 and tops out at 97, and if he can regularly locate it to the top of the zone, it's going to be a plus pitch. But command has never been Jump's strong suit, which is a big part of why teams were hesitant to go all-in and sign him out of high school. He has a thick, mature build, a violent delivery, and very little feel for location. His slider and curveball effectiveness are each below average due to Jump's lack of command. There are scouts who really like him, but here Jump is evaluated as a one-pitch relief prospect with spotty control."
Rio Foster,RF,LAA,2028,,35+,High,21.8,30,30,55,45,"Foster was an Athens, Georgia high schooler who ended up at Florence-Darlington Tech (they're the Stingers), a South Carolina junior college. He slashed .386/.481/.665 there and looks like a good Day Three pick, as Foster has slugged his way onto the prospect radar. He spent the end of 2023 and the first half of 2024 hitting some epic backfield blasts before thriving at Inland Empire for the last few weeks of the season. Foster has above-average raw power right now and might have another full grade in him at peak. Issues with plate coverage might become more of a problem for Rio as he climbs the minors, so he's graded as a high-variance, power-hitting sleeper at the bottom of the system for now."
Jorbit Vivas,2B,NYY,2025,,35+,Low,24.1,50,60,40,50,"After hitting for plus contact at the lowest levels of the Dodgers system, Vivas began hitting for modest power in 2021 and has hit 10-15 homers each of the last few years. During that time, he was traded to the Yankees and spent 2024, his first year in the org, at Scranton. Vivas broke his orbital bone during spring training and slashed .225/.348/.358 upon his return. Small but strong, Vivas doesn't have big raw power, but he takes a pretty healthy hack for a guy his size and he's maintained above-average contact rates as he's climbed the minors. Where he hasn't progressed is on defense. Vivas is not especially good at either second or third base. He is a bottom-of-the 40-man type who can play a low-impact 2B/3B platoon role on an active roster."
Herick Hernandez,SIRP,ATL,2028,,35+,High,21.6,,,,,"Hernandez spent two years at Miami Dade Community College before matriculating to The U for his junior year. In his lone season as a Hurricane, Hernandez K'd 95 in just 70.1 walk-prone innings as a starter. He left campus with a 1.58 WHIP and 6.14 ERA, but was still the Braves' fourth rounder on talent. Miami has not done a good job of developing pitchers on campus and it's possible Hernandez still has developmental meat on the bone. In his couple of post-draft outings, he was no longer using his college curveball and was pitching more off a mid-80s slider, which was a few ticks harder than his college version. Hernandez sits 91-94 from a vertical slot and his fastball features 20 inches of vertical break, though when adjusted for his 6-foot-4 release height (kinda nuts considering Hernandez is just 5-foot-10), that's more of an above-average amount of movement rather than an elite amount. Still mostly a developmental prospect, Hernandez has a reasonable lefty relief outcome and will need to find both a third pitch and starter-quality command in order to outpace that forecast."
Michael Prosecky,SP,COL,2026,,35+,High,24.1,,,,,"After pitching out of the Louisville bullpen for his entire college tenure, Prosecky's pro career got off to a great start in the Fresno rotation in 2023. He began 2024 on the shelf with elbow inflammation, but he was good when he returned: 14 games, 48.2 IP, 78 K (but a 1.42 WHIP). Prosecky only sits 91-93 mph, but hitters don't seem to pick it up. The southpaw has a short, vertical arm stroke that helps his heater play as an in-zone bat misser despite below-average velocity. He hides the ball forever and it appears to jump on hitters very quickly. He throws a classic 12-to-6 curveball off of that, a pitch that's virtually indistinguishable from his fastball until it starts to bend with huge, bat-missing depth. Those two pitches give Prosecky a lower-leverage reliever's foundation. Prosecky's arm stroke isn't always well timed, and his strike-throwing results have been mixed during this try as a starter. In the 2024 Fall League, Prosecky was working with a second breaking ball, a slider in the 82-84 mph range that looked below average. There's definitely more variance here than is typical for a guy who sits 92, but Prosecky is tracking like a low-leverage lefty."
Gabriel Reyes,SIRP,DET,2027,,35+,High,21.7,,,,,"The low-release-height lefty returned from Tommy John surgery to throw a ton of strikes down the stretch in 2024. Right now he has a low-90s four-seamer with minimal ride – though it does have upshoot angle – and his changeup feel is raw, but Reyes struck out 33.9% of hitters in 47.2 innings at Lakeland last year and generates a ton of chase on his slider."
Raymer Medina,2B,TBR,2031,,40,High,17.4,50,55,40,50,"Set to begin his pro career in the 2025 DSL is Medina, a medium-framed, switch-hitting middle infielder with a well-rounded toolset who signed for $1.1 million in January. A lack of size prevents any of those tools from being projected to plus, and there are scouts who think Medina is a better fit at second base than at shortstop. Medina's swings are like mirror images of each other; it's remarkable how similar they are, as most switch-hitters have two distinct cuts, regardless of their age and experience. Medina is a sound fielder with great footwork and hands, but his arm strength is not yet a shortstop fit. This is a nice low-level prospect to monitor for strength gains, because so much of the rest of Medina's profile is quite favorable."
Dylan Smith,SIRP,DET,2025,,35+,Low,24.8,,,,,"Smith was a pitchability righty who broke out during his draft year at Alabama. He has missed a large portion of the past two seasons with forearm and shoulder issues, but his stuff has been pretty good when he's been healthy. Last year that meant Smith was sitting 92-94 mph with plus vertical movement, while also generating miss rates north of 40% with both of his breaking balls. He has not been able to consistently work with great command — it varies pretty substantially outing to outing — but at this point, it's likely Smith will just be deployed in relief and that should matter a little less. He pitched in one Grapefruit League game prior to list publication and was again in the 92-94 range with a plus slider and a good splitter, which he seldom used in 2024. He's right there with Wilmer Flores as an oft-injured prospect whose stuff was good enough at peak to continue caring about him for at least one more year."
Brett Bateman,CF,CHC,2026,,35+,Med,23,55,60,30,60,"Little Bateman posted a .319/.406/.373 career line at Minnesota and has continued to post great OBPs so far in pro ball. The diminutive outfielder has a patient approach that prioritizes opposite field contact. He just barely runs well enough to play center field, and plays it with the sort of infectious, wreckless abandon that fires up his teammates. Bateman is smaller than a typical big leaguer; Guardians outfielder Will Brennan (who got stronger in pro ball, but still isn't especially powerful or big) is a fair comp for what to hope Bateman can grow into. Especially if opposing pitchers attack him fearlessly due to his lack of power, his OBP skills will probably dip a bit as he climbs. Bateman has enough in the way of skills to have some prospect value, but he's probably a low-impact bench outfielder if he makes it."
Jose Alpuria,CF,ARI,2028,,35+,High,20.1,40,40,45,70,"The D-backs signed Alpuria for $100,000 out of Venezuela, and he was among the more exciting Snakes prospects to come to the U.S. from the D.R. at the end of 2023. Alpuria spent 2024 on the complex, where he struck out in 25.5% of his 165 plate appearances while showcasing his plus-plus speed by swiping 16 bags in 18 attempts. He's an athletic dev project with plus bat speed that comes at the expense of body control due to the high-effort nature of his hacks. Many of Alpuria's best swings come with two strikes, when he quiets everything down, rather than earlier in counts, when his tends to get overly aggressive with his passes. Alpuria’s willingness to chase out of the zone has also contributed to his lack of contact and his groundball tendency. His peak exit velocities are very impressive, but he only had five extra base hits last season. Defensively, Alpuria continues to get time at all three outfield spots. His speed is conducive to being able to handle all three positions, but his routes aren’t always efficient. He has made some plus plays in the corners and we're projecting him in center field, where he projects as a toolsy part-timer."
Yulian Barreto,SS,SFG,2031,,35+,High,17.5,40,40,30,50,"A very small, defense-oriented shortstop, Barreto is a skilled, smaller player with good defensive hands and actions. His offensive upside is limited by a lack of size and power projection. He signed for just over $1 million at the start of the 2025 international period."
CJ Alexander,3B,ATH,2025,,35+,Med,28.7,30,40,50,45,"The Athletics claimed Alexander off waivers in September after the Royals released him following a four-game cameo for their big league club. Alexander posted a .302/.361/.559 slash line along with 52 extra base hits in 411 trips to the plate against Triple-A pitching in 2024. His approach, which is heavy on chase (34% in 2024) and light on walks (8% career walk rate), limits how much his hit tool will play at the major league level, but his ability to tap into his juice in games and to handle multiple corner defensive positions is enough to provide up/down utility."
Felix Morrobel,SS,LAA,2029,,35+,High,19.5,40,40,45,45,"Morrobel is a toolsy developmental shortstop prospect who signed for just shy of a million bucks in 2023. Stocky and physically mature, Morrobel's rocket arm strength is what gives him a shot to stay at short even if he continues to fill out more and slows down a bit. He's capable of sizzling the baseball to first base from deep in the hole, and his arm could compensate for what might be below-average range during the bulk of his career, but like most aspects of his game, he is often playing a bit out of control. 
On offense, Morrobel swings with impressive bat speed from both sides of the plate, but it takes him a ton of effort to generate it. He managed to keep his K rate down to an inspiringly low 12.9% in 2024 as he slashed .308/.400/.327 with as many walks as strikeouts for the Angels' complex affiliate. Visual evaluation of his breaking ball recognition suggests there is a regression coming in this area, and Morrobel might be a chase-prone hitter as he climbs. His lefty swing has a downward-cutting bat path that looks rather ineffectual, and indeed Morrobel averaged a negative launch angle in 2024 (-3.9 degrees); he'll likely require a swing change at some point if he's going to make any sort of impact contact. You can clearly see why Morrobel got the signing bonus he did, but at this stage, he's much more of a toolsy dev project than an ascendant everyday shortstop."
Francisco Vilorio,RF,NYY,2030,,35+,High,18.4,35,40,55,50,"Vilorio signed for $1.75 million in January of 2024 as a power-hitting outfield prospect of considerable size. He had a strikeout-prone pro debut, K'ing about 33% of the time in the DSL. Vilorio's physical prowess is sufficient to keep him on the main section of the prospect list despite his red flag contact performance, though his grade has obviously dropped way below his pre-signing 40+ FV mark. Vilorio's hands are still incredibly powerful, and he shows feel for all-fields contact when he's able to put his bat on the ball. A tendency to chase exacerbated his issues last year. He needs to show improvement in this area in 2025 to stay on here."
Logan Samuels,SP,ATL,2028,,35+,High,23.1,,,,,"Samuels is an interesting dev project from Division-II Montevallo because he's able to create a tough horizontal split between his two-planed slider and changeup. These two pitches have above-average movement that, given Samuels' small-school background, has yet to be fully harnessed. In the lone pro inning that Samuels threw after the draft, his fastball was sitting four ticks harder than it had been when he was pitching in March, the only data point I have for him as an amateur. He presents a fairly typical look athletically and mechanically, has room to fill out and add strength, and could conceivably throw harder yet even though he was a senior sign. Samuels never worked more than 68 innings in any single season at Montevallo, and how he responds to a pro starter's workload will be another key to his prospectdom. For now, he's a great sleeper to monitor toward the bottom of the system."
Isaiah Coupet,MIRP,COL,2027,,35+,Med,22.5,,,,,"Coupet is a low-slot lefty with a huge breaking ball who struck out 12.45 per 9 IP across a career-high 86 innings in 2024. He never worked more than 64 innings at Ohio State and struggled with walks as an underclassman, but he's thrown enough strikes the last two years to merit development as a starter. Another potential barrier: Coupet has a fastball that only sits about 90 mph. His two breaking balls are both fantastic, especially his tight, low-80s slider, which Coupet commands to the glove side with consistency. He can subtract velocity and bend in a nasty mid-70s curveball, which is a good first-pitch weapon against righties, but Coupet's arm slot, plus his lack of velocity or a changeup, make him otherwise vulnerable to significant platoon splits. He's likely a bulk reliever who specializes in lefties."
Leonardo Pineda,CF,TBR,2030,,40,Med,17.9,40,40,45,60,"Pineda signed for $1.75 million in January of 2024 and had a solid pro debut, posting a .253/.378/.364 line and a 109 wRC+ in the DSL. He has good looking bat speed and mature power, but he is a smaller-framed player who lacks big long-term strength projection. Pineda runs and throws well, and is a virtual lock to stay in center field as he matures, in part because it's tough to envision him outgrowing the position. Scouts also like how hard he plays. Pineda's contact performance in his debut season is a little scary (70% contact in the DSL), but he remains a higher-profile complex-level follow for 2025."
Wilmer Flores,MIRP,DET,2025,,35+,Med,24.1,,,,,"Born in Venezuela and signed out of an Arizona junior college, the brother of the other Wilmer Flores (seriously) stomped onto the prospect radar throughout the 2021 season, which he wrapped peaking in the 97-98 mph range with a hammer breaking ball in the Arizona Fall League. His health and stuff have waxed and waned since then, including again during the spring of 2025. Flores sat mostly 92-94 in 2023, then his velo was up in the 95-97 range again when he was moved to the bullpen at the start of 2024 before he was shut down for several months with an AC joint sprain in his shoulder. When he returned late in the year, his stuff had backed up into the low-90s. He elected free agency after the season and re-signed with Detroit on a minor league deal, but his shoulder has been a persistent enough issue that he needed a PRP injection in January and will begin 2025 on the shelf. 
Healthy Flores has a power fastball and two good breaking balls — a spike curveball and a cutter — which briefly made him a Top 100 prospect after his scintillating 2022 season. His injury history has not always featured arm stuff; for instance, he dealt with a hamstring issue in 2023. Though mostly a bounce-back candidate at this point, peak Flores was nasty enough for him to retain some prospect clout."
Riley Martin,SIRP,CHC,2025,,35+,Med,27,,,,,"Martin has the look of a good lefty reliever thanks to his fantastic breaking stuff, but he badly needs to rein in his control if he's going to be a consistent part of a big league bullpen. He has two really nasty breakers in the low-80s with tight movement and bat-missing depth. His heater has enough carry to keep it above barrels despite pedestrian velocity. The ingredients for a rock solid mid-game southpaw option are here, it's just that Martin has had several consecutive years of walk rates in the teens or worse. He failed to improve enough in 2024, his 40-man platform year, to be added. Martin is a near-term change of scenery candidate with good enough stuff to hang on the bottom of the list even though he's approaching 27."
Tytus Cissell,SS,ARI,2029,,35+,High,19,40,40,45,55,"Cissell was a skinny-as-a-rail, switch-hitting infield prospect who added something like 20 pounds of muscle between his junior and senior years of high school. He broke out at 2024's Super 60 preseason indoor event, which often features Midwest and cold weather prospects. He was scouted more heavily during the spring, and then had a great 2024 Draft Combine performance. He has capable pro swings from both sides of the plate, with the right-handed one producing more raw power but inferior contact rates to Cissell's classic, low-ball lefty stroke. He's an above-average athlete and runner (he ran a 3.65 30-yard dash at the Combine) who came to the infield relatively late, and played a lot of second base and center field for the Royals' high school scout team. He's a dev project on defense who might end up backing into rare versatility at multiple up-the-middle positions. This is a seemingly late-blooming sleeper who got $800,000 to eschew a commitment to Missouri."
Djean Macares,CF,SFG,2031,,35+,High,16.9,55,55,40,50,"Macares is a stocky, contact-oriented outfield prospect with a fairly mature build. He was the best hitter at the WBSC's U-18 European Championships, where he whiffed just twice in 39 swings. His cut is usually on time to pull the ball and is geared for lift. Macares doesn't have big raw juice or physical projection, and he may instead be a table-setter type of hitter in a part-time outfield role."
Myles Naylor,3B,ATH,2028,,35+,High,20,40,40,50,40,"Naylor had a lackluster offensive season in 2024, posting an OPS of just .643 while punching out at a 35% rate. Even more of a red flag, Naylor also carried a 35% in-zone swing-and-miss rate on the year, which speaks to his inability to manipulate the barrel to cover multiple quadrants. Naylor’s bat speed still warrants above-average marks, but a stiff lower half hinders his ability to rotate explosively and forces him to use only his hands to move the barrel around. On the defensive side, Naylor has been playing shortstop. His hands are soft, but again, stiffness in Naylor's lower body hinders his mobility and range; ideally, he'll improve in this area while he's still feasibly young enough to do so."
Bryan Martinez,RF,LAA,2029,,35+,High,19.3,40,45,55,40,"A sweet-swinging first base and corner outfield prospect (who got some third base reps in 2023), Martinez experienced a sizable offensive uptick in his second DSL season, slashing .275/.391/.394 with 11 extra-base hits in 45 games in 2024. He has a gorgeous lefty swing with beautiful fluidity and loft, and there's a chance that Martinez will clear the relatively high bar for raw power at the corner positions depending on how his body develops. He's swinging and missing a little too much to be a high-value prospect, but a relatively strong visual report has Martinez on the radar."
Richard Matic,3B,NYY,2030,,35+,High,17.7,40,45,55,30,"Matic, who signed for $850,000 last January, didn't have a very good pro debut, but he was just 16 for all but the last few weeks of the 2024 DSL season, and he holds serve as a notable young prospect near the bottom of New York's list. His swing is too ferocious to dismiss Matic even though he just hit .196 at the lowest level. Matic's underlying contact data is closer to average, but he's too passive a hitter and runs a ton of deep counts simply because he rarely swings. Matic has a young edge rusher's build and has uncommon athleticism for a player his size. He has a shot to stay at third base even though players his size tend not to. A 2025 bounce-back candidate, Matic needs to improve in his second DSL go around to stay on here."
Kadon Morton,SIRP,ATL,2026,,35+,High,24.4,,,,,"Drafted as a high school outfielder in 2019, Morton flamed out as a hitter in 2023 and switched to pitching in 2024. He began the season as a piggyback starter, then moved to the bullpen in late July and worked an inning or two at a time for the rest of the year, accumulating 47.1 total innings. Morton allowed runs in just two of the 10 games he pitched out of the bullpen late in the season, though in each of those he allowed five. 
The raw material Atlanta has to work with here is very, very exciting, and even though Morton wasn't throwing all that hard immediately upon conversion, the potential for growth in this area is substantial because of how gorgeous his delivery is. This is an elite athletic mover on the mound. He has one of the more picturesque deliveries you'll see, and generates seven feet of extension. Morton's fastball features slightly above-average ride and his slider, which generated a 47% miss rate in 2024, has nice two-planed shape. This is still more of an aggressive, somewhat speculative way to line Morton up in this system because he's an A-ball conversion arm with a bloated ERA, but the way this guy moves invites one to dream on his stuff."
Kade Strowd,SIRP,BAL,2025,,35+,Med,27.5,,,,,"Strowd is a cutter-heavy kitchen sink reliever whose high-effort delivery compromises his ability to command the ball. Strowd's whole-body delivery only has a modicum of consistency because of how short his arm action is. He'll reach back for 97-98 with his fastball, but hr tends to favor his low-90s cutter early in counts and use his fastball as a chase pitch. Off of that he has a mid-80s curveball and upper-80s changeup, both of which flash plus. Strowd spikes a ton of non-competitive pitches and, even though he generated a ton of swinging strikes against Triple-A hitters, he's carried an elevated ERA. He needs to find another level of control to be rostered, but his stuff is too nasty to omit from the list."
Ryan Ritter,SS,COL,2027,,35+,Med,24.4,30,30,40,50,"Ritter is a flashy but inconsistent shortstop defender who had a 24 home run/20 stolen season in 2023 (though keep in mind, he was an SEC alum in the Cal League). Ritter produced more modestly in 2024 — .270/.370/.403 with a .353 BABIP — but that was still good for a 126 wRC+ in the Eastern League. Ritter does some acrobatic stuff at shortstop but, even at age 24, he needs technical polish. He's well-built and mobile enough to continue to develop at short, but a lot of what he does there takes a little too long, and scouts' opinions of Ritter's defense are all over the map. Ritter has good power for a middle infielder but looming issues against sliders, including ones that finish in the zone, have me stopping short of projecting him for enough offense to be a good team's utilityman. Instead, he's a bottom-of-the-40-man type whose athletic longevity and power should keep him in that area for a while."
T.J. Nichols,MIRP,TBR,2027,,40,Med,22.8,,,,,"Nichols was a good college starter at Arizona and has been deployed as a starter so far in pro ball, but his fastball's ""round down"" elements (like the pitch's plane and its mild amount of sink) don't really allow it to miss bats, and his command also detracts from its effectiveness. Nichols is talented, however. He throws hard (94-97 for the last three seasons) and has a nasty two-plane slider that appeared to be more sweeper-y in 2024, as well as a changeup that could improve because of his delivery's arm speed. Especially after a successful first full pro season in the rotation — 71.1 IP, 1.21 WHIP, 22.9% K%, 7.6% BB% — he merits development as a starter, but realistically, Nichols projects as a good middle reliever."
Paul Wilson,SP,DET,2028,,35+,Med,20.3,,,,,"Wilson, who signed for just shy of $1.7 million in 2023, had a rough pro debut in 2024, as he walked a batter per inning and had an ERA over 6.00 on the Florida complex roster. It was a surprise considering Wilson seemed like one of the more advanced prep pitchers in the 2023 draft class. In addition to being quite wild, Wilson's velocity was down from the 92-94 mph range he showed in high school and was more often in the upper-80s. His curveball still has lovely depth and 12-to-6 shape, while his low-80s slider is less dynamic. Wilson is purely in the bounce-back category at this point. He seemed like a potential no. 4/5 starter in high school but looked like a non-prospect in 2024."
Nick Dean,MIRP,CHC,2027,,35+,High,24.3,,,,,"Dean had a roller coaster career at Maryland, as he dealt with lingering forearm issues and got knocked around as an upperclassman. He was the Cubs' 19th round pick in 2023 and pitched at both of the team's A-ball affiliates in 2024 as a 23-year-old. He covered just over 90 innings and struck out 23% of the batters he faced. His medium frame is still thin with room for additional weight, but it’s not an overly athletic operation, so no substantial velocity gains should be expected regardless of the role Dean is working in. Dean is now working with two breaking balls, a vertical mid-70s curveball with significant depth that will flash average bite and a slider with sweeper-style break. The curveball looks to have a better chance of being an average offering for him in the future, while the slider looks bound to be fringy. The headliner in Dean’s mix is a low-80s changeup that he throws with serious conviction, and that features late depth and sink that plays well off of the running action of his fastball. This changeup will get outs at the big league level and should spearhead a bulk relief role."
Ivan Luciano,C,ARI,2030,,35+,High,18.3,50,40,45,40,"Luciano, a Puerto Rican catcher who was committed to Miami of Ohio, signed for just shy of $1 million as the final of Arizona's four picks in the first two rounds of the 2024 draft. He was a young-for-the-class catcher with a great looking swing. Luciano's whole body is well-connected throughout his swing, and his hands work with natural loft and impressive thump for a hitter his age. He's shown feel for tucking his hands in to handle pitches on the inner half of the plate, though Luciano wasn't a showcase fixture and until postseason developmental activity in Arizona, he just hadn't seen very much pro-quality pitching. As you can imagine, this extends to Luciano's defense, which is sushi raw. He has above-average arm strength but needs to improve his accuracy. The rest of Luciano's defense is in its infancy, but he only turned 18 a few days before Thanksgiving 2024, so that's totally fine. He's a slow-developing catcher prospect with uncommon offensive upside."
Yohendry Sanchez,C,SFG,2030,,35+,Med,18.4,30,,45,20,"Sanchez barely played in his first pro season. He signed for just shy of $1.4 million in January of 2024, got underway in the DSL in June, was active for three weeks, and then was shut down for undisclosed reasons for the rest of the year.  His amateur report is carrying the freight here. He is a viable defensive catcher prospect (his arm strength is better than his receiving right now) with above-average power for a hitter his age. There are scouts who think he'll develop truly plus raw power at peak and others who think he's more or less maxed out (including your author). He's a developmental prospect at a premium position."
Yunior Tur,SIRP,ATH,2026,,35+,Med,25.6,,,,,"Tur, 25, is a Cuban righty with a riding mid-90s fastball. He got his walks down to a workable level in 2024 while throwing a career high 90.1 frames, albeit as a very old Low-A pitcher. Tur controls his 6-foot-6 frame well and his mid-90s fastball can bully hitters up in the zone. His upper-80s splitter will flash plus, while his breaking ball is still very inconsistent and easy to identify out of his hand. There’s a chance something clicked for Tur in 2024, and he’s someone to keep a close eye on in 2025."
Austin Gordon,SP,LAA,2028,,35+,Med,21.8,,,,,"Gordon began his draft year in Clemson's rotation but was moved to the closer role toward the end of March. He stretched out to five innings (and struck out 10) again at the very end of the season for a postseason game against Florida, and at his size (a wispy, loose 6-foot-5), there's a chance he can be stretched out again in pro ball. Gordon sat 95 as a reliever and 92 as a starter in 2024, and his mid-80s slider is his secondary weapon of choice, with a slower curveball occupying most of the rest of his repertoire. He has a collection of average pitches, with great long-term physical projection for a college prospect. There are many developmental avenues that Gordon's career might take, but he's pretty likely to wind up a lower-leverage member of a pitching staff pretty quickly."
Antonio Gomez,C,NYY,2026,,35+,Low,23.4,20,30,30,30,"Gomez has an elite arm and will consistently pop below 1.8 seconds on throws to the bag. He also has power, slashing .241/.329/.419 with a 50% hard-hit rate at mostly High-A Hudson Valley after he returned from injury in the middle of the 2024 season. Gomez still has serious pitch recognition and bat control issues that will limit his offensive output. He's also still not a very good ball-blocker, and for all his other merits on defense, this is still a pretty serious issue. If/when Gomez improves that issue, he'll have a glove-first backup profile. Until then, he's more on the 40-man fringe as a third catcher type."
Jorge Juan,SIRP,ATL,2025,,35+,Med,26.1,,,,,"Juan was once a very young and inexperienced addition to Oakland's 40-man roster, but he struggled to stay healthy and (later on) to throw strikes. He was released and re-signed in 2022, then elected free agency after the 2023 season and signed with Atlanta. The 6-foot-8 righty found slightly better control than he had in 2023, walking ""only"" 15.8% of opponents at Double-A in 2024. Juan then pitched for the Dominican Republic in the Premier12 tournament and then in the Puerto Rican winter league. He held his stuff that entire time, and was still sitting 94-99 during that span. 
Juan is enormous, but he's a short-strider who generates much less extension than you'd expect from a pitcher this big. He tends to be relatively upright at release, which gives his pitches the steep plane of a runaway truck ramp. This most benefits Juan's power breaking ball, which doesn't pop out of his hand in an identifiable way. Juan's size, arm strength, and breaking ball performance give him a shot to break into a big league bullpen as a late-bloomer."
Braylen Wimmer,SS,COL,2028,,35+,Low,24.3,30,35,40,45,"It's fair to be skeptical of Wimmer's 2024 Low-A performance — .285/.362/.435, 14 home runs, 34 stolen bases — both because of his age and his big school background, but his ability at shortstop is a constant that will play at every level. He has poise, grace, good hands, and plenty of arm. Expect Wimmer's strikeouts to climb as he traverses the minors; he lacks bat control but has enough power to be dangerous against pitches down and in. It should be enough offense for Wimmer to play a bench infield role."
Ben Peoples,SIRP,TBR,2026,,40,Med,23.9,,,,,"Peoples is a whippy-armed righty who signed for $350,000 back in 2019 rather than go to Xavier. He has been developed as a starter since entering pro ball, but he's struggled enough with his control to invite a projection to the bullpen, especially now that his 40-man platform year has come and gone. Peoples carried a 1.16 WHIP and 3.42 ERA across 12 2024 Double-A starts before he was shut down with an injury in mid-June and didn't pitch the rest of the season. He has looked healthy during 2025 Cactus League play, as Peoples has been sitting in his usual 93-96 mph range coming out of the bullpen. 
A loose, fluid athlete with a beautiful arm stroke, Peoples' arm action was shortened in 2023, but he's still had trouble throwing strikes. He creates near perfect backspinning action on his fastball, which lives above the zone, and off of that Peoples tries to drop hard, upper-80s slider/cutters into the top of the box. He lacks a plus secondary weapon right now, but his changeup looked good in limited 2024 action, and that pitch might have another gear with time and increased usage. We're betting on Peoples' athleticism and delivery here, and still think he has a future as a fastball-heavy up/down reliever who has a chance to entrench himself in a more regular big league role if one of his secondary pitches improves."
Carson Rucker,3B,DET,2029,,35+,High,20.6,40,40,50,40,"Rucker's pro career hasn't been able to get off the ground, as the high school draftee only played during 2024 extended spring training and a couple of FCL games before he tore his right labrum sliding into a base. He is a projectable infielder who was signed away from a Tennessee commitment for $772,500 in 2023. Rucker has a strong top hand that generates impressive pull power when his swing is on time, though his lever length may not always allow for that in pro ball. His present power and long-term power projection are his carrying tools, while his relatively grooved swing creates some hit tool risk that will prove more concerning if Rucker outgrows shortstop. For now, he's a raw developmental infielder with a shot to have corner-worthy power."
Derniche Valdez,SS,CHC,2029,,35+,High,19,30,40,50,60,"Valdez was one of the better infield athletes in the 2023 international class, an explosive individual with rare power for a teenage hitter his size, let alone one who is athletically capable of playing the middle infield. He signed for $2.8 million and has had a chaotic two years in rookie ball, slashing .247/.323/.488 across those two seasons amid pretty serious strikeout issues and two team-instituted suspensions for taking unannounced in-season trips back to the Dominican Republic. 
Valdez has absurd bat speed in a vacuum, not just for a player his age and size. His ball-in-play data (55% hard-hit rate, 111 mph max exit velocity, 106 mph EV90) is nutty for a teenage shortstop prospect. This kind of ability is freaky enough to keep Valdez on the main section of the list even though he otherwise has a lot of growing to do both on and off the field. He has a wreckless approach at the dish and chases a ton, which is largely why his strikeout rates are already in a red flag zone even though he's in rookie ball. It's going to be fascinating to watch this guy's career unfold because Valdez has so much talent that he'll likely keep being given opportunities even if everything about him continues to be choppy."
Junior Ciprian,SP,ARI,2029,,35+,High,19.8,,,,,"Arizona had three or four interesting DSL arms in 2024, but Ciprian is generally seen as the best of them, and he has the best present fastball by a lot. His four-seamer averaged 95 mph in 2024, featured about 20 inches of vertical break on average, and induced whiffs at a nearly elite rate. At a long-limbed 6-foot-3, there's a chance Ciprian is going to throw harder as he matures. Deployed in outings that tended to last just two or three innings, we still need to see whether Ciprian can retain this kind of fastball effectiveness across a starter's load of innings. Until then, he's a projectable young sleeper more than a true impact prospect."
Hayden Wynja,SIRP,SFG,2026,,35+,Med,26.5,,,,,"Wynja pitched at four different colleges in four years — first at Purdue, then Lincoln Trail College, South Florida, and finally Murray State — after which he was signed as an undrafted free agent in 2022. For a minute it looked like the gigantic 6-foot-9 lefty had added several ticks to his fastball, which sat 87-88 mph at Murray State, then was suddenly in the 90-92 range in 2023, but that backed up in 2024, as Wynja was once again in the upper-80s. He was still having a good year and appeared to be peaking, with multiple good, six-inning starts at the end of May, but he was shut down shortly thereafter until close to the very end of the regular season. 
Wynja's best pitch is his slider, which is very difficult to spot out of hand because it's always descending from a super high release point. That pitch alone should allow him to play an up/down lefty specialist role. If there's some late-arriving arm strength or changeup quality (which seems plausible because of his size and nomadic amateur background), then perhaps he'll be able to work toward the back of a rotation."
Nate Nankil,RF,ATH,2027,,35+,Med,22.5,50,50,40,40,"Nankil was the A’s seventh round selection out of Cal State Fullerton in 2023. His frame is lean, with room for additional strength in the coming years. He split the season between both A-ball affiliates, posting an .862 OPS with 11 homers and 39 extra-base hits. Nankil’s bat path has loft to it without sacrificing how long his bat stays in the hitting zone, but he has average bat speed. He’s limited to the corner outfield positions, where he projects to be an average defender. Because he lacks a true outlier offensive tool, he projects as an up/down role player in the future."
Carlos Espinosa,SIRP,LAA,2025,,35+,Med,23.6,,,,,"Espinosa pitched in a piggyback role with the Astros for the first two years of his pro career and then was traded to the Angels for Trey Cabbage before the start of the 2024 season. The Angels moved him to the bullpen, and Espinosa's two-plane slider became his most frequently used secondary pitch. He posted a 30.7% strikeout rate at High-A and then wrapped the year with 10 fair outings at Double-A. It looks like Espinosa is having a velo spike during winter ball in Puerto Rico. In the days before Angels list publication, he was sitting 95-98 rather than his usual 93-96. If he can sustain that into 2025, then he might seize control of a bullpen spot in perpetuity. Here he's projected as more of an up/down option due to the lack of a plus secondary pitch."
Luis Serna,SP,NYY,2027,,35+,Low,20.7,,,,,"Serna is an athletic, undersized righty who has struggled to leave the lower minors due to injuries. He suffered a shoulder injury in 2023 that limited him to just shy of 20 innings, and his 2024 ended on the full-season injured list due to elbow inflammation. Serna's low-90s fastball is very vulnerable to extra-base contact because of its lack of movement, but his secondary pitches are great. His 80 mph changeup has an amazing amount of tailing action and can get a whiff even when it finishes on the plate. He can vary the shape and speed of his slider and curveball, which aren't as nasty as Serna's changeup but survive thanks to his advanced command. He may end up as a long reliever because Serna is small, he hasn't demonstrated durability, and he needs to pitch backwards a lot of the time to shelter his fastball. The 2025 season is his 40-man evaluation year, so the Yankees might push him from Hudson Valley to Somerset at some point as a stress test for his stuff. Here he's evaluated as a low-leverage long reliever."
David McCabe,3B,ATL,2027,,35+,Med,25,45,55,55,30,"McCabe is a dangerous switch-hitter with high-effort power from both sides of the plate. He lacks a true position (he's played mostly third base as a pro, but isn't mobile enough to do so at the big league level) and will probably be a bench weapon rather than a regular starter. He slashed .276/.385/.450 with 17 bombs in 2023, then had offseason TJ and missed most of 2024 recovering; he struggled at Double-A Mississippi and in the Arizona Fall League after he returned. He's a 2025 bounce-back candidate who needs to perform on offense to remain on here."
Kyle Karros,3B,COL,2027,,35+,Med,22.7,40,50,50,30,"One of Eric's two sons in pro ball (Jared pitches in the Dodgers system), Kyle hit .276/.342/.407 at UCLA and signed for just over $430,000 in 2023. He hit .311/.390/.485 in his first full season, another of the Rockies' recent college draftees who put up monster numbers at hitter-friendly Spokane in 2024. Karros is very likely not <em>that</em> good a hitter. He's a stiff-legged athlete whose upright manner of swinging leaves him very vulnerable to secondary stuff at the bottom of the zone. Karros' carrying tool is his third base defense. He's not explosive or rangy, but he's incredibly smooth and capable of making great throws from all kinds of odd platforms. It's important for Karros to add strength to his 6-foot-5 frame, as he needs to develop power to counter a below-average contact projection. That and the introduction of other corner positions on defense are key developmental variables to watch as Karros treks toward a four corners bench role."
Jackson Lancaster,SIRP,TBR,2026,,40,Low,26,,,,,"Lancaster was a two-way junior college player for two seasons at Itawamba before he transferred to Missouri for his junior year and pretty much stuck to playing the outfield with the Tigers. Then he transferred to Louisiana Tech and played both ways again in 2022. Signed as an undrafted free agent in 2023, he is now focusing solely on pitching and has had A-ball success in two seasons. Lancaster has developed a great breaking ball in a pretty short amount of time and looks like a pretty standard lefty middle reliever. His slider is excellent and he commands it to the glove-side corner of the plate with consistency. It moves late and has tight, two-plane action that slips below the barrels of opposing lefties. Lancaster's low-90s fastball punches above its weight a bit because it features above-average vertical movement. This is a nice scouting and dev success story for the Rays, who have a future specialist on their hands conjured from an undrafted former two-way player."
Andrew Dunford,SP,DET,2029,,35+,High,20.2,,,,,"Dunford signed for just under $370,000 to eschew a commitment to Mercer. He has an exciting combination of projection (he has room for another 30-plus pounds of mass) and athleticism (big drop-and-drive delivery and hip/shoulder separation), especially for a pitching prospect this size. He only threw four innings after signing in 2023 (Dunford's fastball averaged 95 mph out of the chute) and then just a third of an inning in 2024 before he was shut down with an elbow strain, which cost him the entire year. Dunford and the Tigers have a ton of work to do on his command and breaking ball situation (he had an inconsistent curveball in high school and is basically starting from scratch in pro ball), but he was a fun mid-six-figure pull on the third day of the draft and is an important low-level prospect to monitor."
Kyle Amendt,SIRP,ARI,2026,,35+,Med,25,,,,,"Amendt is a late-blooming illusionist righty with a cut/rise fastball and a deceptive delivery. It allows his fastball to rush past hitters despite 20-grade velocity. Amendt spent two seasons at Southeastern Community College in Iowa, was a medical redshirt for his first year at Dallas Baptist, and then only worked 9.1 innings the following season. In his draft year, he struck out two batters <em>per inning</em> in 25.2 frames of relief work and went in the ninth round. Then Amendt raced all the way from High- to Triple-A in 2024, his first full pro season. He was utterly dominant at High- and Double-A before the wheels came off his strike-throwing at Reno. 
Amendt generated a 15% swinging strike rate in 2024, among the best in the org, even though his fastball sits just 88-92 mph. D-backs fans familiar with Josh Collmenter will have some idea as to how Amendt's fastball works. It often has between 17-22 inches of vertical break and a little bit of natural cut. His over-the-top trebuchet arm action hides the ball forever, and the long-levered Amendt generates nearly seven feet of extension. His fastball has been playing like a plus-plus pitch. Amendt tries to dump his curveball in the zone and then get chase above it with his fastball. He mixes in a mid-80s slider/cutter with short lateral action and very little depth. It's the pitch Amendt commands best. His command was pretty rough during his five-outing Fall League stint and keeps him down here in an up/down relief bucket even though we buy that his combo of stuff and deception is of big league quality."
Cale Lansville,SP,SFG,2027,,35+,Med,22.2,,,,,"Lansville had a successful full-season debut, throwing 77 innings across 22 outings (16 starts) with a measly 6.8% walk rate and a 4.36 ERA in the Cal League. His pitch mix is more switched on than most junior college draftees in their first full pro season. Lansville sits 92-94 with downhill plane, he has a good 12-to-6 curveball, he locates a fair cutter/slider mix to his glove side, and his changeup has enough action to project as a viable fourth offering. Lansville is more of a powerful, high-effort athlete than he is a coordinated one. His true command talent probably is not that of a 7% walk rate guy. It's possible his walk rate will tick up as he climbs, and for that reason I'm inclined to project Lansville as more of a spot starter or long reliever than a consistent fifth starter."
Richard Fernandez,SIRP,ATH,2027,,35+,High,22.5,,,,,"Fernandez's fastball was in the 95-97 mph range last spring after sitting 92-95 in 2023, but he tore his labrum toward the end of extended spring training, and he didn't pitch at an affiliate all season. In addition to the fastball, he also has a 2,800 rpm slurve in the 84-86 mph range and a changeup that has shown plus action. This is purely a wait-and-see inclusion for Fernandez, who looked like he might have been breaking out just before he got hurt."
Fulton Lockhart,SIRP,LAA,2028,,35+,High,21.2,,,,,"Lockhart began his college career at South Florida and then transferred to the College of Central Florida as a sophomore. He pitched for the Sanford River Rats in the 2024 Florida Collegiate Summer League and struck out 23 guys in 9.2 innings of work there (seriously). Lockhart then made himself known to the pro scouting community after the draft with a walk-prone 13 innings at Inland Empire, where his fastball was up to 101, velo he maintained at instructs. He has unbelievable arm speed and a whammer of an arm action that's tough for Lockhart to control. He showed three different secondary pitches during instructs, my favorite of which was his upper-70s curveball; his mid-80s slider and upper-80s changeup were less consistent. Another of the many hard-throwing dev projects in the Angels system, Lockhart's sparse experience and smaller school background indicate he will benefit from reps and pro instruction."
Franyer Herrera,SP,NYY,2028,,35+,Med,19.9,,,,,"A fairly advanced three-pitch lefty, Herrera had a good 2024 DSL season —  49.1 IP, 64 K, 17 BB, 2.01 ERA — in his third year on the circuit; he was likely still there because he threw just 20.1 innings combined the prior two years. Herrera is a spindly 6-foot-1 or so, has a deceptive, vertical delivery, creates above-average ride on his fastball, and uses two advanced secondaries to finish hitters. His slider has in-zone utility against lefties, but his changeup, which sits 82-85 mph, is his most advanced offering. Herrera projects as a secondary-heavy backend starter and might move quickly in 2025 and 2026 because he's a fairly advanced strike-thrower."
Juan Mateo,SS,ATL,2030,,35+,High,17.9,55,60,40,55,"Mateo is a bat control prodigy with terrific hand-eye coordination and a preternatural ability to cover the top of the strike zone. He was the best non-Perdomo hitting prospect in Atlanta's DSL group and was among the org's leaders in contact rate. Mateo is wiry and fairly projectable, but he's not at all strong right now. In fact, at 3%, he'll probably have the lowest hard-hit rate of any prospect on a list during this cycle. But his feel to hit, long-term body projection, and potential athletic fit at shortstop (his internal clock needs to be recalibrated, but otherwise he's pretty good there) make him a good low-level prospect to follow. He's likely ticketed for a second DSL season."
Derek Bernard,LF,COL,2028,,35+,Med,19.6,30,45,55,40,"Bernard is a hard-swinging corner outfield prospect who leveled the 2023 DSL (his second year in the league) because of his physicality and bat speed. He slashed .296/.360/.440 in Arizona in 2024 but K'd a terrifying 32% of the time. Of fullback build, Bernard has a rare combination of short levers and big strength, and he's going to get to power in games by virtue of this. However, he lacks traditional physical projection and has exhibited some strikeout red flags so far. He swings with big time effort and can lose track of the baseball during the process. After playing mostly second base in his first pro season, Bernard largely shifted to left field in year two and played exclusively in the outfield corners in 2024. Bernard's ability to punish the baseball makes him a notable young prospect, but he'll need to cut the strikeouts to profile toward the bottom of the defensive spectrum."
Austin Vernon,SIRP,TBR,2025,,40,Med,26.1,,,,,"The gigantic Vernon had a velocity spike late in his college career, going from averaging 92 mph to averaging 94-95 and touching 98 over his final few outings with North Carolina Central. He has now reached the upper levels of the minors and has continued to have bat-missing success, but Vernon wasn't added to the Rays' 40-man last offseason and went unselected in the Rule 5 Draft. Here, he continues to project as a middle reliever. 
Vernon's pro transition from early-career swingman to single-inning relief role is now complete; after making a handful of starts in 2022 and 2023, every one of his 2024 outings came in a one- or two- inning burst out of the 'pen. Vernon has much better feel for landing his upper-80s slider than he does his other pitches. That pitch played like a plus offering in 2024 even though it lives more off its velocity than movement. Vernon's fastball averages 95 mph, and he held that velocity into the fall, when he pitched for Team USA's Premier12 group. His heater tends to sail on him fairly often. His changeup flashes bat-missing tail, but isn't often located enticingly. He isn't an exceptional athlete or pitch executor, but Vernon is a fairly standard middle reliever whose stuff is seasoned by some deception due to his size and nearly seven feet of extension."
Edgar Isea,SIRP,ARI,2027,,35+,High,22.6,,,,,"Isea is an erratic relief prospect with some of the best arm strength in Arizona's entire system. He's now sitting 95-98 and regularly reaches triple digits, but Isea’s control woes have persisted since he entered pro ball in 2019, and he walked almost 20% of the batters he faced while hitting six more over his 34.1 frames in Visalia. Isea’s best sliders will feature a two-plane shape with significant depth and plus bite, but his ability to maintain that shape and locate around the zone is still very spotty. He also has a splitter in his mix that ranges between 85-89 and features modest tumbling action. The fastball/slider combo is high-end stuff, and whether Isea is able to get his walks down to a tenable rate will determine if he becomes a high-leverage guy or a volatile middle reliever. He's not an especially projectable athlete, and so here we're expecting the latter."
Braxton Roxby,SIRP,SFG,2025,,35+,Med,26,,,,,"Undrafted out of Division-II Pittsburgh-Johnstown, Roxby was recruited by Reds dev personnel via a post-draft Zoom meeting in which they explained how to better use his pitches (you can find a link to David Laurila's interview with Roxby detailing the signing on his player page). Roxby's fastball was up two ticks in 2024 and now lives in the mid-90s with uphill angle and tail. A funky lower slot creates these characteristics. He tends to pitch backwards off of his sweeping mid-80s slider, which he commands better than his fastball. Acquired for Taylor Rogers, Roxby has the stuff of a pretty standard middle reliever, though his command puts him in more of an up/down bucket."
Breyson Guedez,LF,ATH,2031,,35+,High,17.5,30,30,50,50,"Guedez, who is similar to Rangers prospect Yeison Morrobel in terms of his build, is a tweener outfield prospect with good bat speed and an awkward looking swing. Guedez can move the barrel around some, but his bat path isn't on plane with the baseball for very long. He's got good bat speed, but he's a smaller guy without a ton of long-term power projection. If Guedez needs to move to an outfield corner, it will be tough for him to have prototypical power. He signed for $1.5 million in January."
Ubaldo Soto,SP,LAA,2030,,35+,Med,18.7,,,,,"A relatively projectable 18-year-old righty, Soto struck out a batter per frame and posted a 1.09 WHIP across 56 DSL innings. He's loose, strides down the mound well, and fills the zone. His low-90s fastball has a fair amount of carry, and one can project on Soto's secondary stuff based on his athleticism and fluidity. He's a very green developmental pitching prospect who had a strong age-17 season in 2024."
Ben Shields,SIRP,NYY,2026,,35+,Low,26.2,,,,,"Shields played six years combined between two different colleges, first UMass and then George Mason, where he spent 2022 and 2023. The Yankees reworked Shields' delivery, gave him a lower arm slot, and he was dominant in 2024, his first pro season. Splitting the year between High- and Double-A, he pitched in 26 games, 17 of them starts, threw 106 innings, and posted a 11.63 K/9, a 2.80 BB/9 and a 3.01 xFIP. 
Shields is now throwing a couple ticks harder than he was in college, but his meal ticket pitch is his low-80s slider, which has really nasty two-plane movement. The changes the Yankees made to Shields' delivery give his fastball a little bit flatter angle. If he were to move to the bullpen and add another couple of ticks, that might be a second above-average pitch for him. Assuming he keeps living in the 91-94 mph range, he looks more like a solid lefty specialist."
Mario Baez,SS,ATL,2029,,35+,High,18.6,45,40,40,50,"Baez had issues identifying spin on the complex in 2024 and had a flop of a season on offense — .202/.272/.243, 48 wRC+ — compared to his 2023 DSL debut. His underlying contact data was still pretty good (he had a .254 BABIP), and Baez stands out visually for his explosive in-the-box athleticism. Baez swings with shocking ferocity for a hitter his size. At just 5-foot-9, he utilizes a huge leg kick and move back toward the pitcher during his swing. The chase portion of Baez's profile is definitely scary, but the athleticism and bat-to-ball combo here is still too exciting to move off of him as a prospect. For now, he's a toolsy bounce-back candidate who'll hopefully be more selective during his second season stateside."
Lebarron Johnson Jr.,SIRP,COL,2026,,35+,Med,22.8,,,,,"A two-year member of the Longhorns' starting rotation, Johnson is perhaps better suited for the bullpen in pro ball. He has a heavy mid-90s sinker with extreme downhill plane — he has a vertical release height just shy of seven feet tall. He'll bump 98-99, but tends to live in the 93-96 mph range. Johnson's upper-80s slider runs downhill with even more vertical finish, and is as hard as 90-91 mph. As his fastball is more of a grounder-getter, Johnson's slider is his lone realistic bat-misser, and he barely throws a changeup. He walked 4.8 per 9 IP in college, another indication that Johnson is headed for a relief role."
Sam Knowlton,SIRP,ARI,2027,,35+,High,24.8,,,,,"Knowlton spent two years at Pensacola State Junior College before he headed to South Alabama for three more. He only threw a few innings in 2021 and then missed 2022 due to a stress fracture and UCL tear in his right elbow. His fastball was in the 97-101 mph range when he returned in 2023 and has been in that area in pro ball. Knowlton has poor control and walked nearly a batter per inning in his 2024 pro debut, but he's enormous, relatively undeveloped, his slider has promising depth, and Knowlton has elite arm strength. That's enough for him to have some prospect value even though he needs to improve his strike-throwing a ton just to sniff the big leagues."
Spencer Miles,SIRP,SFG,2026,,35+,High,24.7,,,,,"Miles went undrafted as an eligible sophomore and had an ERA over 6.00 at Mizzou, but the Giants still used a pretty high pick on him, and when the strapping 6-foot-3 righty has been healthy, that has looked like a good move. Healthy Miles will peak in the upper 90s and show two viable secondary pitches — a hard 88-92 mph slider, and an upper-80s changeup — but back and elbow issues have cost him all but a few weeks of the last two seasons; he's thrown just 14.2 affiliated innings since turning pro. His repertoire is deep enough to have justified development as a starter, but given Miles' injury history, it's probable that he ends up in relief. Once that happens, it's possible Miles will move very quickly, and his stuff is big enough that he has prospect value even though he has barely pitched."
Elvis Alvarado,SIRP,ATH,2025,,35+,High,26.1,,,,,"Alvarado has been on the prospect radar since 2018 when the Nationals, who signed him as an outfielder, moved him to the mound and Alvarado was immediately into the mid-90s. Since then he has struggled to find viable big league control and hopped around to different orgs via trade (Mariners), the minor league Rule 5 (Detroit), minor league free agency (Miami, Pittsburgh), and waiver claim (Athletics). The Pirates gave Alvarado a big league deal during the 2024-25 offseason as he was sitting 97-99 with Estrellas in the Dominican Winter League, then lost him on waivers to the A's. Alvarado's slider/cutter is very inconsistent, so he uses his fastball over 80% of the time. While the Tigers had him throwing strikes during the couple of years he was in their org, Alvarado tends not to. He's likely an up/down reliever, but with elite arm strength in tow, he definitely has more upside if some team or pitching coach can help him find a plus secondary pitch."
Francis Texido,MIRP,LAA,2028,,35+,Med,20,,,,,"The Angels signed Texido for $250,000 out of Cuba in 2023 and he dominated the DSL in his first pro season. He had a rude, walk-prone awakening in 2024 as he struggled to throw strikes at Low-A Inland Empire, issuing free passes at a 16.6% clip. Texido also struck out a batter per inning despite having an 86-89 mph fastball because he's incredibly deceptive. Most cross-bodied pitchers have lower arm slots, but Texido's slot is vertical and deceptive. Ryan Yarbrough's delivery is a close a mechanical comp, but Texido's stride direction is more akin to DJ Herz or a younger Sean Manaea. Texido will show you a plus tailing changeup, but he struggled to get into changeup counts in 2024. He's still an interesting smoke-and-mirrors prospect with a unique delivery and release."
Chris Kean,SIRP,NYY,2027,,35+,Med,22.8,,,,,"Kean spent two years at Ranger College, which is halfway between Fort Worth and Abilene, and then was injured for much of his junior year at Monroe, a season that ended with a Tommy John. When he returned from rehab in 2024, he was utterly dominant on the complex and at Low-A even though he wasn't even throwing as hard as he was at ULM. That's because Kean's fastball has big riding life and he commands it to the top of the strike zone with regularity. At a strapping 6-foot-5, Kean and his gorgeous arm action look like he'll at least rebound and sit 93-94 mph like he did during his handful of innings with the Warhawks, if not more. At that point, Kean will have a plus fastball, though he and the Yankees will need to polish his 78-83 mph breaking ball, which is currently a bit below average. Kean might also be able to conjure a changeup out of thin air — he certainly has the arm action for it. Kean is a fun small school sleeper who could reach Double-A by the end of 2025, especially if his peak arm strength returns."
Logan Workman,SP,TBR,2025,,35+,Med,26.3,,,,,"Workman went to Soddy Daisy High School in Tennessee and pitched for the Savannah Bananas during the summer of 2020 after his junior year was squashed by COVID. Drafted as a fourth-year junior out of Division-II Lee University in 2021, Workman has climbed the minor league ladder and ended his 2024 season in Durham. He pitched 146 innings in 2024 and carried a 2.96 ERA. At the very end of the year, Workman was still touching 95-96 and sitting 93. His fastball is average when properly elevated, but it's vulnerable to big damage in the zone. Workman will mix in a terse cutter/slider and an average changeup. He fills the zone, is a well-built 6-foot-4, and his delivery is easy and consistent. There isn't a plus pitch here, but Workman's durability and strike-throwing consistency should enable him to play a spot starter role."
Sandy Ozuna,SP,COL,2029,,35+,High,18.8,,,,,"Ozuna had among the best stuff of Colorado's complex-level group in 2024 but his ultra-long, inconsistent arm action creates a lot of relief risk. He worked 37 innings in 10 games (half of them starts), striking out 45 and allowing 48 baserunners. Ozuna's control is worse than it performed on paper, but he has a lightning-quick arm and a shot to develop a nasty fastball/slider combo despite his slider's lack of raw spin. For now, he's a developmental starter prospect with arm strength and not a lot else."
J.J. D'Orazio,C,ARI,2026,,35+,High,23.3,35,40,40,30,"D'Orazio was one of the two Players to Be Named Later who came back from Toronto in the 2021 Joakim Soria trade. He reached Double-A in 2023 but has really struggled to get going on offense since arriving, with a .221/.272/.317 line there in 110 games. D’Orazio still has prospect value because he's a very athletic, well-built player with an incredible arm. He's so fast out of his crouch and his arm action is so short and crisp that he sometimes pops sub-1.8. His accuracy is mixed and a lot of his throws are way above the bag, which is the only thing stopping his arm from being an elite attribute. Though he still has some ball-blocking issues that need to improve, the non-throwing aspects of D'Orazio's defense have taken a step forward and put him on pace to be average back there. A very upright swinger with opposite field tendencies, D’Orazio's offense perhaps has some long-term ceiling because he's such a well-built, athletic guy, but he has yet to perform against upper level pitching and it's going to be very hard for him to be on time against fastballs with his current swing. Were he an ace defender or hitting more, he'd have more of a backup catcher's profile, but as things are currently constituted, he's a third catcher on the 40-man."
Cole Waites,SIRP,SFG,2025,,35+,High,26.8,,,,,"After experiencing delays to his development – first the 2020 shutdown, then a 2021 meniscus tear – Waites rocketed from High-A to the majors in 2022 as he pumped upper-90s gas past hitters and struck out well over 40% of them during the season. He dealt with a lat strain during 2023 spring camp and pitched with reduced velocity when he returned, velo that ticked down more and more throughout the year until Waites went from sitting 97-101 at peak to 93-96 toward the end of his season. He had his second career Tommy John in September 2023 and missed all of 2024.  
Healthy Waites' fastball touches triple-digits, misses bats up in the zone, and punishes righties on the inside of the plate. His slider quality and command were not especially good (he only throws it 20% of the time), and much of the swing-and-miss with his breaking ball is the result of the batter gearing up for the fastball rather than the quality of the slider on its own. Waites hasn't had a ton of reps — his 47.1 innings in 2022 were easily the most of his career. It's plausible he could improve his slider or command enough to be more than the wild up/down reliever he was projected as before his most recent TJ, but another year of missed development will make that more difficult. He'll be nearly 27 when he next throws a competitive pitch. I expect he'll be more of a ""lightning in a bottle"" type reliever who could make a meaningful big league bullpen impact, but probably during a narrow window of time rather than for five or more consistent seasons."
Noah Murdock,SIRP,ATH,2025,,35+,High,26.6,,,,,"Murdock is a lean, high-waisted 6-foot-8 right-hander who transitioned to a relief role in 2023. Murdock’s velocity leapt into a range that he had only previously peaked in, and he’s sat 94-97 mph each of the last two seasons, but he also posted unsightly walk rates above 15%. He has long been of note because of his size and stuff, but he’s dealt with several injuries and inconsistent performance. Murdock throws from a three-quarters slot that produces above-average movement on his sinker when he’s working it down in the zone. He throws both a slider (81-85 mph) and a cutter (87-90 mph), which often share a similar short shape but come in at different velocities. The slider also flashes hard, two-plane depth when he stays on top of it. The Athletics have targeted wild pitchers with huge stuff before (Ryan Cusick, Joe Boyle, Will Klein), and Murdock will compete with that group for a bullpen spot. Rule-5 pitchers this wild tend not to stick on their new club."
Jack Dashwood,SIRP,LAA,2025,,35+,Low,27.4,,,,,"A starter at UCSB, Dashwood moved to the bullpen in pro ball and hung out at Double- and Triple-A for four years before he was put on the Angels' 40-man. He spent most of 2024 injured; he only pitched in April, August and September, then picked up innings in the Arizona Fall League, where he was Mesa's closer much of the time. Dashwood was up to 95 in the AFL. His fastball runs downhill, and he has two firm secondaries in his upper-80s slider and changeup. The slider's descent is notably nasty. Dashwood's feel for location is not as precise as his career walk rates might otherwise indicate, but his line to the plate is direct enough for him to throw strikes. Dashwood projects as an up/down southpaw reliever who could grow into a more regular second lefty role if he keeps throwing strikes."
Jerson Alejandro,SP,NYY,2028,,35+,High,19.1,,,,,"Alejandro is a massive 18-year-old righty whose performance regressed in his second DSL season. His athleticism at his age and size is still remarkable enough for him to retain prospect value, but Alejandro's command needs to improve in 2025. He struggled with high, arm-side fastball misses in 2024 and plunked 16 batters in 37.2 innings. The shape of his fastball's movement was all over the place, though at its best, it has late sink and tail, and jumps on hitters thanks to Alejandro's 6-foot-9 inch extension. Alejandro is a loose hip-and-shoulder athlete, and it's too soon to expect that he'd have precise control of his limbs. His stuff and build are that of an innings-eating sinker/slider starter, but he needs to hone his fastball release and become a better craftsman."
Trevor Martin,SP,TBR,2026,,35+,Med,24.3,,,,,"Martin was up to 98 at Oklahoma State, where he was a draft-eligible sophomore reliever in 2022. He rocketed up draft boards late in the spring when he punched out 16 hitters in a 6.2-inning relief appearance during a Regional elimination game, working 93-96 for most of that outing. Like a lot of the college draft picks in this org, the Rays have tried to upcycle Martin into a starter, and so far it's working. He coasted through both A-ball levels the last couple of years and spent the second half of 2024 at Double-A, where his peripherals backed up into more of an average area. Martin hasn't sustained his peak 2022 velo and was more 90-94 with his fastball in 2024, but plus vertical break and above-average extension help enable a fastball-heavy approach despite that middling velo. Aside from his curveball, which has movement that pairs with his heater, Martin doesn't have a secondary pitch that's performing at an average or better level. His durability and fastball playability make him a likely spot starter, but we'd like to see better secondary stuff teased out of Martin before considering him a lock to eventually make the Rays' rotation."
Gregory Sanchez,SP,COL,2030,,35+,High,18.2,,,,,"Sanchez was Colorado's hardest-throwing DSL pitcher in 2024, a big-framed, high-waisted, long-armed 6-foot-4 righty who works in the mid-90s with sink and tail. He made 13 starts and worked just 33.1 innings, so whether he can maintain that velo across a starter's share of innings remains to be seen. His release is fairly inconsistent (as is his breaking ball quality) and he is a tad more filled out than the typical teenage pitcher. Both those things add to the relief risk here, but from a stuff standpoint, Sanchez has the foundation of a good young starter prospect. In addition to his sometimes 96-97 mph fastball, he has an average, bullet-style slider in the 82-85 mph range and an impressive power changeup in the 88-90 mph band. He's a developmental name to know with a great arm."
Jack Hurley,CF,ARI,2027,,35+,High,23,30,30,40,55,"Hurley's center field defense kept him afloat on this update in spite of his hit tool's putrescence. Hurley slashed .245/.305/.404 at Hillsboro and K'd at a 26.9% clip. His underlying contact rates are a red flag, especially his sub-80s% in-zone rate. Hurley cuts right through a ton of pitches in the middle of the zone and lacks barrel feel, but he can swing pretty hard and gets to most of his roughly average power. More importantly, after the trade of Andrew Pintar, Hurley was able to play center field more regularly and looked pretty good. Hurley sometimes goes out of his way to show off his arm and can risk overthrowing the cutoff man or base, but you would too if you could uncork it like he can. Barring a huge rebound to Hurley's contact ability, his ceiling is limited to that of a reserve outfielder."
Luis Velasquez,SIRP,NYY,2026,,35+,High,23.7,,,,,"Velasquez is a wild little righty reliever whose arm is too fast for him to control. He K'd 56 in 41.1 innings (almost of which came in relief) at Double-A in 2024, but he also walked 31. Velasquez's pitches are arguably both 70s on the scouting scale when they're located, but too often they're nowhere near where they need to be, and they play down as a result. Velasquez needs to develop another grade of control to be a big leaguer at all, but he wields nearly elite arm strength at age 23 and thus needs to be on this org's prospect list."
Mike Vasil,SP,TBR,2025,,35+,Low,25,,,,,"Vasil looked like a late first/comp round prospect in high school, then suffered an untimely injury as a senior and only pitched a little bit before the draft, sitting his usual 92-95 mph. He ended up at Virginia, where he regressed, and he was sitting 91 throughout his draft year. Like a lot of pitchers who leave Virginia, Vasil had a rebound in pro ball and was back to sitting 92-95 for a couple of seasons before his velocity trended down again in 2024, when Vasil was knocked around at Triple-A Syracuse. Vasil has a deep coffer of below-average pitches, though his curveball played better toward the end of last season. At peak, it looked like he'd compete for a rotation spot on a good team, but right now he looks more like a spot starter. With so many Rays arms returning from injury, it's going to be an uphill climb for Vasil to make the active roster as a Rule 5 pick."
Kamuel Villar,SS,COL,2031,,35+,High,17.6,40,40,45,50,Villar is a lefty-hitting infielder who is at least as likely to end up at second or third base as he is shortstop. He is fairly projectable and already has some verve and authority in his wrists.
Jose Fernandez,SS,ARI,2026,,35+,High,21.5,30,30,40,50,"Fernandez is similar to former Cleveland and Pittsburgh prospect, and current Dominican Winter League stalwart, Erik González. Fernandez is a great shortstop and third base defender with a huge arm despite an odd looking throwing stroke. He has never produced an above-average offensive statline at any minor league level, but Fernandez is a very well put together 21-year-old who should remain athletic enough to play good defense at a couple different infield positions for a very long time. There's a chance he adds enough power during his 20s to have some offensive relevance, but this forecast is for Fernandez to be a bottom-of-the-40-man player."
Thomas  Balboni Jr.,SIRP,NYY,2026,,35+,Med,24.7,,,,,"Balboni is a sidearm reliever who experienced a two-tick velo bump in 2024; he was traded from San Diego to New York for Brandon Lockridge when the Padres badly needed outfield depth. Balboni has a career ERA over 6.00, but he's struck out 125 guys in 87 pro innings. He has big time arm speed for a low-slot guy and generates six and a half feet of extension with a big stride down the mound. This type of low-slot rise/run fastball and slider combo platter is becoming more common across baseball, and Balboni is an older, developmental version of it. His slider spins at nearly 2,800 rpm, but he doesn't command it well enough to garner many whiffs right now. Polishing his command and shaping his slider to have more two-plane tilt will be key to Balboni seizing a big league bullpen job."
Yereny Teus,MIRP,TBR,2028,,35+,High,21.7,,,,,"Even though he was an older prospect, Teus was left back in the DSL for a second consecutive season and was utterly dominant, posting a 0.96 WHIP and striking out 71 in 54 innings. Teus is a twitchy, undersized southpaw with a deceptive delivery and quality secondary stuff. He sits about 92 but will touch 95, he hides the baseball forever, and his fastball's carry gives it belt-high bat-missing ability. Teus' high slot helps hide his curveball, which doesn't pop out of his hand and instead just dives in a way that's tough to decipher, while his arm speed helps sell his changeup, which has tail and fade. This is a sneaky backend starter's mix, it's just that so far, it has only been productive against immature hitters who are much younger than Teus. With a strong 70 or so innings in 2025, he'll move into at least the 40 FV tier."
Kenny Castillo,C,ARI,2027,,35+,Med,20.9,30,30,35,20,"Castillo is a big-framed, defense-oriented catching prospect with middling bat speed. He's a skilled and dynamic receiver who'll go to one knee while he receives the pitch rather than start on one knee and remain static. His size and comfort back there are both very promising, while Castillo's arm strength and accuracy are more average. He needs to improve as a ball-blocker, but he's only 20 and has the frame to absorb errant pitches. On offense, Castillo has a swing driven by his bottom hand and doesn't do a ton of damage. At his age and size, he has a chance to develop more power, but realistically he's a good reserve catching prospect."
Hansel Rosario,SIRP,NYY,2028,,35+,High,22.7,,,,,"Rosario signed as an old-for-the-class pitcher in 2022 and spent two walk-prone seasons in the DSL before having a third on the domestic complex in 2024. He is on this list because his stuff is very nasty. Rosario often sits 94-97 across as many as three or four innings, and his fastballs sometimes have 20 to 22 inches of vertical break, though just like his locations, their movement is all over the place. Rosario also has a plus 82-85 mph sweeper-style slider with big length and enough depth to play as a backfoot weapon against lefties when it's located. Rosario is an older developmental arm with comfortably plus stuff. Every once in a while, a guy like this will become a Félix Bautista type and have a dominant peak, though most tend to hover on the roster fringe."
Logan Driscoll,C,TBR,2025,,35+,High,27.4,40,40,40,30,"Four years after being the third piece in the Emilio Pagán-Manuel Margot trade, the former second rounder made his big league debut last year as a third catcher during a 15-game September call-up, which feels about right for him. Driscoll doesn't show special agility or hands for a catcher, but a whole hog investment in a one-knee'd stance has him in position much more often than not, though he does post below-average pop times. With average raw power and some feel for lift, Driscoll, who has a career .269/.348/.437 line in the minors, can put elevated mistake breaking balls into the right field seats. That can lead him to chase velocity at the letters, which his below-average bat speed and prominent bat tilt don't allow him to touch. Big league arms were very content to let Driscoll chop lower-third soft stuff during his cameo, and life as an up-and-down catcher won't offer much room for adjustment."
Roman Angelo,MIRP,ARI,2027,,35+,Med,24.9,,,,,"Angelo spent three years at Cal State Bakersfield before transferring to Fresno State for his fourth and fifth collegiate seasons. In his first full pro season, Angelo was promoted to High-A Hillsboro after a dominant month at Low-A. Across the entire season, he struck out 151 batters and walked just 50 in 121.1 innings, posting a 3.49 ERA and 1.20 WHIP. Angelo has enjoyed a three-tick velocity boost across his entire repertoire and now looks like a potential sinker/slider long reliever or swingman. His delivery isn't especially graceful, but Angelo is a big, physical guy who should be developed as a starter for a while to see if he can polish his strike-throwing."
Colton Ledbetter,CF,TBR,2026,,35+,Med,23.4,30,30,50,50,"Ledbetter transferred to Mississippi State for his draft year after two stellar underclass seasons at Samford and hit .320/.452/.574 against the SEC in 2023. Assigned to High-A Bowling Green in 2024, his strikeouts really spiked, and he ran a 28.3% K% during an otherwise successful season that saw him hit .273/.339/.484. Ledbetter has a classic low-ball swing and can golf loud contact to all fields, but he's very vulnerable to elevated fastballs, resulting in a 68% contact rate in 2024. He's a fair center field defender who needs to retain the speed he currently has to stay there. Doing so should give Ledbetter a fringe 40-man fit as a power-hitting extra outfielder."
Hayden Durke,SIRP,ARI,2027,,35+,Med,22.9,,,,,"Durke began his college career at Louisiana-Lafayette, then transferred to Rice, where he did not pitch due to a PED suspension. His fastball averaged 95-96 on the Cape in 2023 and the D-backs gave him an over-slot $350,000 in the 13th round. Durke struggled with walks (he did in college, too), but otherwise had a successful first full pro season. His fastball sat 93-98 throughout the year, and he has two distinct breaking balls that both flash plus depth. His slider is hard, in the 85-89 mph range, and his curveball has traditional 12-to-6 shape. Without improved command, he's likely an up/down type, but Durke hasn't pitched a ton and might improve in this area."
Mac Horvath,CF,TBR,2026,,35+,Med,23.2,40,40,45,60,"Part of the Zach Eflin trade return from Baltimore, Horvath is a twitchy multi-positional player with good power for a hitter his size. He's smaller and wiry, but he swings hard, his hands are strong through contact, and Horvath generate doubles-quality spray aided by his speed. Horvath is also an incredible 49-for-52 in career pro stolen base attempts, and he sure looked safe on his lone 2024 caught stealing with Bowling Green. He's taken bags at an 88% clip dating back to college. Limiting Horvath's role is his defense. He's error-prone on the infield, both at second and third base. Baltimore gave him some outfield reps prior to the trade, but the Rays did less of that. Defensive versatility is going to be an important part of Horvath's role, and that piece of his game needs to be ironed out throughout 2025 and 2026."
Connor Foley,SIRP,ARI,2028,,35+,High,21.7,,,,,"A draft-eligible sophomore in 2024, Foley was at his best in late March and early April, but struggled late in the season. Though he surrendered eight runs in his final start of the year for Indiana, Foley's fastball was sitting 94-96 and touched 99 in that game. He signed for an over-slot $1 million in the fifth round and was shut down after the draft. Foley needs to develop as a strike-thrower. His style of pitching (fastballs above the zone, changeups and sliders that tend to land in the upper half of it) is inefficient, and there's a good chance Foley will just be a reliever. But with just two years of college ball under his belt, it's possible he'll improve. Foley's changeup has 15-plus mph separation from his fastball and generated a miss rate north of 50% in 2024. His 82-85 mph slider is more of a strike-getter than a finisher. At 6-foot-5 and 235 or so pounds, Foley has the build to start, but he needs to polish his control and show that he can sustain this kind of velocity throughout 20-plus starts to alter his current bullpen projection."
Homer Bush Jr.,CF,TBR,2027,,35+,Med,23.5,40,40,30,80,"Bush was acquired from the Padres in the Jason Adam trade ahead of the 2024 deadline and slashed .272/.363/.363 combined across both orgs' High-A affiliates. His carrying tool is his speed. Bush is among the most explosive and graceful runners in all of baseball, capable of reaching first base in four seconds flat from the right side of the dish. His speed gives him huge long-term ceiling as a center field defender if he can continue to improve there with lots of pro reps. Right now, he's capable of making some spectacular plays, but looks a little uncomfortable at the catch point on the occasional routine one. Bush began using a bat with a weighted knob while with the Padres and started diving to the outer portion of the plate to cover breaking balls. He struggles to handle fastballs (71% contact rate versus heaters in 2024) and his offensive ceiling is fairly low. Right now, he projects as a specialist due to his speed, but if Bush's center field defense improves, he'll be more of a true fifth outfielder."
Daniel Eagen,SP,ARI,2028,,35+,High,22.4,,,,,"Eagen is a well-built 6-foot-4 righty with a mid-90s fastball and two breaking balls. He pitched sparingly as an underclassman due to injuries and wasn't great when he did, but then Eagen enjoyed a big velo boost in his draft year, sitting 93-95, and struck out 121 batters in 77.2 innings. His higher release point causes downhill dilution on his fastball, but adds depth to a low-80s curveball, Eagen's best pitch. This is a small school dev project with big league-quality arm strength and breaking stuff. He got better in 2024 and, under pro tutelage, might continue to do so."
Angel Brachi,SS,TBR,2030,,35+,Med,18.2,55,55,30,60,"Brachi signed for $800,000 in January of 2024 and was ranked higher on our international amateur board than a player getting that kind of bonus typically would be. He's a gritty scout favorite with limited tools but advanced baseball acumen and feel to hit. Brachi slashed .247/.348/.276 in his pro debut and looked better at shortstop than was expected when he signed. He has a long-term utility look."
Andrew Saalfrank,SIRP,ARI,2025,,35+,Med,27.6,,,,,"Saalfrank played a meaningful bullpen role for the Diamondbacks toward the end 2023, including during the postseason, a stretch that saw him throwing strikes. He has a pretty standard low-leverage lefty relief fastball/curveball combination when he's going good. Deception and extension helped his 2023 fastball play better than its 91-93 mph velocity, but his heater was down two ticks at the start of 2024 and was missing bats at one-third of the rate it did the season before. His low-80s curveball was still getting results, but in June, Saalfrank was suspended for a year for betting on baseball. According to MLB's investigation, the bets were placed in 2021 and 2022, totaled less than $500, and did not involve games Saalfrank pitched in. He should be back to playing an up/down role in Arizona's bullpen by the middle of 2025."
Eliomar Garces,SS,TBR,2031,,35+,High,17.6,45,45,30,50,"A precocious shortstop defender, Garces has exceptional footwork and actions, and enough arm strength for the left side of the infield. He's somewhat more projectable than the Rays' other high-profile signees from the 2025 international class, but he's lacking in bat speed. Garces' upside is contingent upon him getting stronger; otherwise, his ceiling is realistically that of a good-fielding utilityman. He signed for $1.6 million."
Grayson Hitt,SP,ARI,2026,,35+,Med,23.3,,,,,"Hitt had Tommy John surgery in April of 2023, a couple of months prior to being drafted. He returned at the very end of June 2024 and pitched in six complex-level games and then instructs. Hitt had walk issues all three years of college, and his feel for release is not especially sharp or fluid. He walked 11 batters in his six ACL innings upon his return from surgery. Hitt didn't have a ton of college reps as a starter; he was in the bullpen as a freshman and only made eight starts as a junior before his elbow blew out. Sometimes guys come out of TJ rehab having taken a leap of some kind, be it more velocity or remodeled pitches. That doesn't look to have happened here. Hitt's post surgery velo is right in line with his college look, in the 90-94 mph range with a little bit of natural cut at times. It was tough to evaluate Hitt at the end of 2024 because he was too wild to get into favorable counts and use any of the three different breaking balls he worked with in college. When he was drafted, it felt like he was a higher-ceiling'd college arm who only fell because of injury. Hitt didn't come out of the gates strong at the end of last season, and the control piece of his profile needs to improve in 2025 for him to stay on the list."
Eric Orze,SIRP,TBR,2025,,35+,Med,27.6,,,,,"Orze has a plus-plus changeup and sits 93-95, but he has struggled to throw strikes for most of the last couple of seasons. He was acquired from the Mets in a trade for Jose Siri and should be a multi-inning up/down reliever for the next few years. He could end up as a Trevor Richards type reliever if he can throw strikes. Here he's evaluated as a fairly wild up/down option."
Ricardo Yan,SP,ARI,2026,,35+,High,22.4,,,,,"Yan got off to a rough start in 2024 and then was shut down with a rotator cuff strain in early June; it cost him the rest of the season. Healthy Yan is an extremely projectable low-slot righty with a sinking and tailing fastball and two secondary pitches that flash plus. Even when he was healthy and productive in 2023, he was only sitting in the upper 80s and low 90s, but Yan is so lanky and loose that it was reasonable to hope he might soon throw harder. The divergent lateral action of his fastball and slider is similar to Tanner Houck, though Yan doesn't have that kind of arm speed. Guess wrong and you're either whiffing at the slider, which at times has huge two-plane wipe, or the fastball is going to run into your knuckles mid-swing. Yan needs to both show he's healthy and then have a progression in arm strength to have big league viability, so for now, he's a bounce-back candidate."
Paul Gervase,SIRP,TBR,2025,,35+,Med,24.9,,,,,"Gervase is an enormous 6-foot-10 righty who came to Tampa at the 2024 deadline in a trade for Tyler Zuber. He's struck out a little over 15/9 IP the last couple of years thanks mostly to deception rather than stuff, as despite his size, he has a 5-foot-4 release height and generates nearly seven-and-a-half feet of extension. Even though his fastball sits 91-94 mph, it's a nightmare in on the hands of righties. His arm slot aids his slider's playability, but that pitch lacks consistency because of Gervase's lack of command, and the same is true of his low-90s cutter. He's a high-probability relief contributor who might be limited to an up/down role because of his control."
Juan Morillo,SIRP,ARI,2024,,35+,Med,26,,,,,"Morillo was an interesting low-level prospect during his long tenure in rookie ball, often sitting 93-96 mph with a good slider and projectable frame. Entering 2023, the pandemic and an unfortunately timed TJ had caused him to throw just 1.2 innings since 2019. Out of the gate in 2023, Morillo was sitting 98-100 with uphill angle and a mid-80s slider that didn't have quite the same finish as it used to, perhaps because mechanical tweaks were made to alter his fastball shape. He held that velocity amid conservative usage (he worked just 33 innings) throughout the 2023 season but wasn't dominant, and though the Dodgers cut him loose a little more in 2024 (55 IP), his bat-missing ability backed up even though Morillo was still touching 100. He elected free agency after the season, and the D-backs added him on a minor league deal. He's an arm strength lotto ticket type who'll get a fresh start with Arizona, and hopefully the club will help Morillo find something that will allow him to have some big league success with all that velocity."
Jack Hartman,SIRP,TBR,2026,,35+,Med,26.7,,,,,"Acquired from the Pirates in exchange for Ji-Man Choi, Hartman has spent the last couple of seasons in Tampa's system and climbed to Double-A late in 2024. He was still pumping 96-98 mph gas late in the season and in the AFL, though the pitch plays down a tad due to its downhill plane and a lack of movement. Hartman's upper-80s slider is plus, and he commands it more consistently than his fastball. Still, his command is fringy overall, which has him in more of an up/down relief bucket even though he has consistent middle inning stuff."
Nate Lavender,SIRP,TBR,2026,,35+,Low,25.2,,,,,"Lavender, who was selected in the Rule 5 Draft last December, had the internal brace style of Tommy John early in 2024 and will start the 2025 season on the 60-day IL; he should be back in mid-to-late summer. In 2023, he struck out 86 hitters in 54.1 innings, and Lavender has a career K/9 of 13.7 even though his fastball, which he throws 65% of the time, sits just 91 mph. That’s because he has one of the more deceptive deliveries in the minors. He almost looks like someone who learned to throw with their left arm later in life. There are some Hideki Okajima elements to his delivery, including Lavender’s head whack, which prevents him from seeing his target at release. He gets way, way, <em>way</em> down the mound, generating seven and a half feet of extension. His arm action is also super whippy, and the line on his fastball is incredibly difficult for hitters to get on top of. The rest of his repertoire isn't great, but Lavender smells like an up/down reliever on the back of his fastball alone. If he can come out of TJ rehab with a good second pitch or more fastball velocity, look out."
Alexander Alberto,SIRP,TBR,2027,,35+,High,23.4,,,,,"Alberto spent parts of four seasons in rookie ball and finally left the womb of the complex in 2024. He is still a long-term dev project, even at age 23. Alberto is a statuesque 6-foot-8 and sits 94-97, but wayward command plagues his fastball's effectiveness. The same is true of his mid-80s slider, which has above-average length but no consistency. With even 40-grade control, Alberto should comfortably profile in middle relief, though that's still more projection than it is a reflection of his imminent role."
Marcus Johnson,SP,TBR,2026,,35+,Med,24.3,,,,,"Johnson was one of the most projectable college pitching prospects in the 2022 draft and came to Tampa from Miami as part of the 40-man deadline deal for Xavier Edwards a few offseasons ago. After an efficient strike-throwing season in 2023, Johnson had surgery to remove loose bodies in his elbow early in 2024 and didn't pitch until the very end of the season. He ended up working just 16.1 innings across seven games, and looked about the same as he had pre-surgery. Johnson sits about 93 mph, and his size negatively impacts his fastball's playability because its angle puts it on plane with hitters' bat paths. His slider and changeup were not as crisp last year, but both have been capable of getting whiffs in the past, which was impressive considering that Johnson spent just one collegiate season as a starter. This is purely a wait-and-see valuation of Johnson, who looks like a low-variance spot starter unless something can be done to aid his fastball's playability."
